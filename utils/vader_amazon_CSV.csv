"what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player?",1,"train_pos"
"i guess i'm just lucky to get a good working unit!",1,"train_pos"

"good:  progressive scan player for a relatively low price (although the better known manufacturers like toshiba, pioneer, and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well).",1,"train_pos"
"seems to read most dvds fine, and reads quietly (i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise).",1,"train_pos"

"i bought this as a gift for my sister.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price.",1,"train_pos"
"the second apex - at least it's prettier than the last.",1,"train_pos"
"the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous (ad1100w) is most appreciated.",1,"train_pos"
"back to the 2600:  1.  it doesn't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive.",1,"train_pos"
"2.  without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i've seen.",1,"train_pos"
"3.  excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer, panasonic, and jvc players.",1,"train_pos"
"4.  remote: you can stand it on end (harder to lose), and it's far better designed than the 1100s.",1,"train_pos"
"anyway, the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product.",1,"train_pos"
"i'd have given it 5 stars, but i'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one:  with progressive scan, i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest.",1,"train_pos"
"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "", my dvd player came in perfect working condition.",1,"train_pos"

"goodluck!",1,"train_pos"
"a great discovery!",1,"train_pos"

"so much packed in a small case and very affordable!",1,"train_pos"
"i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house.",1,"train_pos"

"it's not a big deal for me.",1,"train_pos"
"as it is, i'm keeping the machine.",1,"train_pos"
"it works well enough (so far) for me to be satisfied with it, and it's possible that i'm missing something.",1,"train_pos"

"i bought this thing because it plays everything.",1,"train_pos"
"this is the third apex dvd i bought.",1,"train_pos"
"the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision.",1,"train_pos"
"the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties.",1,"train_pos"
"but heck it plays my alias dvds.",1,"train_pos"
"by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet.",1,"train_pos"
"you should too.",1,"train_pos"

"i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts.",1,"train_pos"
"what can i say, i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever, quality design, stable, plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies.",1,"train_pos"
"in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220.",1,"train_pos"
"amazon is awaesome!",1,"train_pos"

"it also has an optical out, which it should.",1,"train_pos"

"i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine.",1,"train_pos"
"still, i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features!",1,"train_pos"
"so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch.",1,"train_pos"
"the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question.",1,"train_pos"
"i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either.",1,"train_pos"
"even though they were not damaged in any way.",1,"train_pos"
"value for money.",1,"train_pos"
"this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it.",1,"train_pos"
"the plus points are -  1.  price  2.  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd, vcd, dvd-r, audio cd and it played all  3.  good looks  the downside -  1.  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate, something that you wouldn't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel  2.  remote buttons are small and closely spaced, especially with the menu buttons.",1,"train_pos"
"if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed, i would rate this a 5 star machine.",1,"train_pos"

"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture, zoom etc.",1,"train_pos"
"so sit back, relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can't do half the things this one can, and for a fraction of the price!",1,"train_pos"
"value value value.",1,"train_pos"
"noiseless, lightweight and oh yeah.",1,"train_pos"
"works great!",1,"train_pos"
"silverish color really adds a special touch.",1,"train_pos"
"who cares if it doesn't have multiple slots?",1,"train_pos"
"it plays just about any format (check before you buy if it plays yours.)",1,"train_pos"
"if you watch dvds once in a while like i do, get this!",1,"train_pos"
"apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there.",1,"train_pos"
"if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours.",1,"train_pos"
"either way, can't go wrong with this price.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent picture quality / color i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase.",1,"train_pos"
"the camera is very easy to use, in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group.",1,"train_pos"
"after i took their picture with their camera, they offered to take a picture of us.",1,"train_pos"
"i just told them, press halfway, wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way.",1,"train_pos"
"they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely.",1,"train_pos"
"(as all of my pictures have thusfar).",1,"train_pos"
"a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet (super fine).",1,"train_pos"
"bottom line, well made camera, easy to use, very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices.",1,"train_pos"
"i'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like.",1,"train_pos"
"great job canon!",1,"train_pos"
"cool toy yep.",1,"train_pos"
"this is my first digital camera, and what a ' toy ' it is!",1,"train_pos"
"i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy, i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera; and i must say, g3 worth every single cent i spent on it.",1,"train_pos"
"just a little overview, powershot g3 is the flagship of canon's powershot series and its an slr-like camera, its 4 megapixel and (alsmost) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance.",1,"train_pos"
"whether you are a novice or an expert, its ease of use and functionality goes together.",1,"train_pos"
"+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes, etc.",1,"train_pos"
"i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast.",1,"train_pos"
"a good choice could be cf type ii, microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images.",1,"train_pos"
"(well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too.",1,"train_pos"
"overall i'm happy with my toy.",1,"train_pos"
"incredible camera i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras.",1,"train_pos"
"a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful, as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made, plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models.",1,"train_pos"
"following my research, i decided on the g3.",1,"train_pos"
"in a word, "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i won't go into the details here, as the online sites (stevesdigicams, dpreviews) go into great depth in their reviews, but i am very pleased with the features, the speed, the picture quality, the flexibility, the automation, and the functional conveniences this camera offers.",1,"train_pos"
"with the automatic settings, i really haven't taken a bad picture yet.",1,"train_pos"
"and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode, it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image.",1,"train_pos"
"i am absolutely in awe of this camera, canon put enormous quality into the g3.",1,"train_pos"
"don't walk, run and buy this camera if you have the budget, i guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1,"train_pos"
"great camera i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied.",1,"train_pos"
"i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 is loaded with many useful features, and unlike many smaller digital cameras, it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds.",1,"train_pos"
"despite this minor disappointment, i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography.",1,"train_pos"
"haven't had practice but i'm already in love with it i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful.",1,"train_pos"
"the photo quality is amazing and i know i'm going to have fun with all the features.",1,"train_pos"
"i've figured out most of its features on my own already (because i have used digital cameras before, so i know things like symbols).",1,"train_pos"
"i'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top, but that doesn't stop me from loving this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent for the semi-serious amateur positives  1) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative, yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you don't want to bother with the settings.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent range of metering options as well.",1,"train_pos"
"it's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen.",1,"train_pos"
"2) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)  3) 4x zoom is nice  4) the great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed.",1,"train_pos"
"5) its focusing system is also very flexible.",1,"train_pos"
"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button, and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus.",1,"train_pos"
"fantastic digital camera the camera has a wonderful set of features.",1,"train_pos"
"the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures.",1,"train_pos"
"you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd.",1,"train_pos"
"the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry.",1,"train_pos"
"the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect.",1,"train_pos"
"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures (purple fringing, etc) so i am very pleased.",1,"train_pos"
"the canon computer software used to download, sort, upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price.",1,"train_pos"
"the best of everything recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available.",1,"train_pos"
"newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box.",1,"train_pos"
"4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome.",1,"train_pos"
"those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use.",1,"train_pos"
"anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference.",1,"train_pos"
"the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it's class.",1,"train_pos"
"i expect the g3 will please me for years to come.",1,"train_pos"
"pure class &amp; quality - a work of craftmanship i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period!",1,"train_pos"
"it gives great pictures, the controls are easy to use, the battery lasts forever on one single charge, the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing.",1,"train_pos"
"i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode.",1,"train_pos"
"absolutely breathtaking.",1,"train_pos"
"i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out.",1,"train_pos"
"the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon, but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon.",1,"train_pos"
"great camera what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you?",1,"train_pos"
"i make photographs at work, and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally.",1,"train_pos"
"i recieved the camera, inserted a larger cf card, charged the battery, and handed it to my wife.",1,"train_pos"
"i showed her how to turn it on, where the lens zoom lever is, and she loves it!",1,"train_pos"
"this camera has canon's great colorimetry, plus what you see in the lcd is what you get.",1,"train_pos"
"the prints are beautiful!",1,"train_pos"
"and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality.",1,"train_pos"
"although canon's batteries are proprietary, they last a really long time, recharge fairly quickly in the camera, plus if you want ' more power ', you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon.",1,"train_pos"
"if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital this is a great camera for you!",1,"train_pos"
"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use.",1,"train_pos"
"i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos!",1,"train_pos"
"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop, shutter speed and even focus.",1,"train_pos"
"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works, and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers.",1,"train_pos"
"but if you've used a slr 35mm camera, the controls are very intuitive!",1,"train_pos"
"once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located.",1,"train_pos"
"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority (for high speed subjects), aperture priority (for focal length) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality.",1,"train_pos"
"the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera also has a great feel and weight to it.",1,"train_pos"
"you feel like you are holding something of substance, not some cheap plastic toy.",1,"train_pos"
"the more i work with it, the more i love it!",1,"train_pos"
"i didn't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i'm thrilled with my purchase!",1,"train_pos"
"outstanding camera this is my first digital camera, and i am very pleased with it.",1,"train_pos"
"i do not know a whole lot about photography, but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform, even as i grow in skill and knowledge.",1,"train_pos"
"seriously, this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want.",1,"train_pos"
"but at the same time, it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode, so that even an average joe like me can use it!",1,"train_pos"
"four megapixels is great.",1,"train_pos"
"i know there are five mp cameras out there, but this thing does just fine for me.",1,"train_pos"
"if you want, check out the canon website and they have some sample images, taken by this camera, for you to download.",1,"train_pos"
"if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex, this is it.",1,"train_pos"
"it is a very amazing product.",1,"train_pos"
"i highly recommend it.",1,"train_pos"
"love my new g 3 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has.",1,"train_pos"
"takes excellent photos.",1,"train_pos"
"night mode is clear as day.",1,"train_pos"
"i have not played with all the features yet, but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it.",1,"train_pos"
"however, using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem.",1,"train_pos"
"overall it is the best camera on the market.",1,"train_pos"
"i give it 10 stars!",1,"train_pos"
"the pictures are brillient i just bought the camera a few days ago.",1,"train_pos"
"before i "" get used to it "", here are my first feelings:  a) the picture quality (color and sharpness of focusing) are so great, it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time: -))  b) the lens cover is surely loose, i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times, and au lens tigt and cause potential damage.",1,"train_pos"
"great gadget i bought this last week through amazon.",1,"train_pos"
"got a great deal from a reputable seller.",1,"train_pos"
"i love this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i am still trying to figure out the may options it has.",1,"train_pos"
"took hundreds of pictures and they were great.",1,"train_pos"
"great colors, pictures and white balance.",1,"train_pos"
"has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range.",1,"train_pos"
"it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for.",1,"train_pos"
"any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort.",1,"train_pos"
"and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i wanted it to shoot concerts as well.",1,"train_pos"
"that meant even less light and just as much action.",1,"train_pos"
"next time i set it at 100 and used the flash.",1,"train_pos"
"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects weren't moving, the photos were awesome.",1,"train_pos"
"the camera was a marvel.",1,"train_pos"
"if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality, this will be your camera.",1,"train_pos"
"it is versatile and seems to be one of the best.",1,"train_pos"
"sure.",1,"train_pos"
"it is less versatile, but i am never disappointed with the output.",1,"train_pos"
"within its limitations i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias.",1,"train_pos"
"i have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move.",1,"train_pos"
"what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses.",1,"train_pos"
"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images.",1,"train_pos"
"at least once youve got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what ive read, is better than just about anything else available.",1,"train_pos"
"what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8.",1,"train_pos"
"once i get focus lock, i can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus.",1,"train_pos"
"fortunately, the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the metz 60 ct-4.",1,"train_pos"
"for those who have this metz flash (or the 45cl-3) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3, the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c.",1,"train_pos"
"contrary to what ive read elsewhere, the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon.",1,"train_pos"
"you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync, which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isnt, its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself.",1,"train_pos"
"but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range, the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera.",1,"train_pos"
"the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you.",1,"train_pos"
"the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.",1,"train_pos"
"i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information.",1,"train_pos"
"maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, youd see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces.",1,"train_pos"
"instead, i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in.",1,"train_pos"
"what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware.",1,"train_pos"
"without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image!",1,"train_pos"
"the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.",1,"train_pos"
"what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical.",1,"train_pos"
"what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality, and then if you want fantasy, you can use photoshop to create it.",1,"train_pos"
"but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 (in conjunction with my professional flash system), and can easily put up with the cameras limitations, because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits.",1,"train_pos"
"knock your socks off great i've had this for 3 months now, and i am pleased with my decision.",1,"train_pos"
"this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well.",1,"train_pos"
"my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time.",1,"train_pos"
"whoa.",1,"train_pos"
"manual functionality is excellent, downloading pictures is quick and a breeze, and the quality is astounding.",1,"train_pos"
"i did a good month's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras, and this is the best buy for the buck.",1,"train_pos"
"not perfect (yes, the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances), not the cheapest 4.0 mp, but the best 4.0 mp.",1,"train_pos"
"or save time and just do it, you won't regret it.",1,"train_pos"
"great digital camera after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine, i decided to head here, to amazon, to read through the online reviews.",1,"train_pos"
"the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera, but, in the end, i figured i'd give the g3 a try.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm very glad i did.",1,"train_pos"
"the service from the supplier was exceptional.",1,"train_pos"
"the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1,"train_pos"
"having used it for more than a month, i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos.",1,"train_pos"
"recently, i attended a "" flyball "" competition  -- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles.",1,"train_pos"
"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot, i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced.",1,"train_pos"
"the camera is a dream to operate in automode, but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual modes.",1,"train_pos"
"in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom.",1,"train_pos"
"this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler.",1,"train_pos"
"i always shoot using the lcd panel.",1,"train_pos"
"i can't write enough positive things about this great little camera!",1,"train_pos"
"canon never ceases to amaze being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation, difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2.",1,"train_pos"
"but canon never fails to amaze.",1,"train_pos"
"some of the great gains over g2 --  1. the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility.",1,"train_pos"
"2. battery life is over 4.5 hours, compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons.",1,"train_pos"
"3. the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing.",1,"train_pos"
"looks sort of like picasa software (google it if you dont know) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2's, but more intuitive.",1,"train_pos"
"4. the shape of this device is a little squarer, without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking.",1,"train_pos"
"a big plus in my book.",1,"train_pos"
"the light auto-correction is awesome.",1,"train_pos"
"you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right.",1,"train_pos"
"6. the g2's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed, the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes.",1,"train_pos"
"there are six default settings (off, vivid, sepia, neutral, low sharpening, b &amp; w) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening, contrast and saturation.",1,"train_pos"
"7. a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view.",1,"train_pos"
"(looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have, er, canonized it a bit).",1,"train_pos"
"8. perhaps inspired by the canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out), the g3 has much sharper white offsets.",1,"train_pos"
"in english, this means that even straight out of the box, you'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking.",1,"train_pos"
"9. in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera, and thankfully g3 maintains this rep.  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors.",1,"train_pos"
"overall, the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams, from a detail, tonal balance and color response point of view.",1,"train_pos"
"there's really very little about g3 images to criticize.",1,"train_pos"
"this is quite simply the best you can ask for.",1,"train_pos"
"with canon, you get pictures that appear to be photos, not still camcorder shots.",1,"train_pos"
"i love the eos based controls and easy menus.",1,"train_pos"
"many before me have done that already.",1,"train_pos"
"i agree with the positive reviews.",1,"train_pos"
"the g2 was better in this respect.",1,"train_pos"
"it had a heavier and more sturdy casing.",1,"train_pos"
"despite these grieps, i still recommend the camera.",1,"train_pos"
"love it more and more i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it!",1,"train_pos"
"canon was an obvious choice, but i did not want to limit my decision, so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives.",1,"train_pos"
"i researched, held, tested, and observed 3 different brands.",1,"train_pos"
"needless to say, the canon won, hands down.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera performs like i can not believe!",1,"train_pos"
"i bought it for my trip to beunos aires, and also used it at the iguazu falls, and could not have asked for more perfect performance!",1,"train_pos"
"it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features, so i generally used the auto mode.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera is worth every penny, and i highly recommend it!",1,"train_pos"
"another point of note: the battery life is incredible!",1,"train_pos"
"i did not have a backup battery, and had no need for one.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera will stay with me for years!",1,"train_pos"
"the last digital camera i'll buy i've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time.",1,"train_pos"
"after a lot of research, i decided on the g3.",1,"train_pos"
"am i ever glad that i decided on this camera!",1,"train_pos"
"i've only had it a week, but so far, everything about this camera is making me happy.",1,"train_pos"
"i've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual.",1,"train_pos"
"very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i charged it up the day i got it, took a bunch of pictures and i don't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged.",1,"train_pos"
"the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging.",1,"train_pos"
"the optical zoom is awesome, and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom.",1,"train_pos"
"as i said, this is the last digital camera i'll buy, and if you are in the market one, my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever.",1,"train_pos"
"the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"highly recommended.",1,"train_pos"
"for more info on digital cameras, go to dpreviews.",1,"train_pos"
"no -- gorgeous you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions.",1,"train_pos"
"because this camera is beautiful.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 looks like a work of art!",1,"train_pos"
"its silver magnesium finish is stunning, and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i've seen.",1,"train_pos"
"the little digital elphs were the best-designed, most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them.",1,"train_pos"
"very good choice in it's price range this is my first digital camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i am very pleased with it so far.",1,"train_pos"
"i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time.",1,"train_pos"
"this seemed like a really good compromise.",1,"train_pos"
"i compared it to the olympus c5050z, the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700.  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews, this one seemed like the best all round deal.",1,"train_pos"
"that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw.",1,"train_pos"
"it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop.",1,"train_pos"
"i have not spent much time with the included software, so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok.  i am quite happy with the camera.",1,"train_pos"
"it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep.",1,"train_pos"
"yes, i recommend it over the competition.",1,"train_pos"
"best of the best best camera ever.",1,"train_pos"
"from the image quality, color, function, i can say almost everything.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature, to find out more just log on to canon's website.",1,"train_pos"
"i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this.",1,"train_pos"
"for those of you who already bought this camera, i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer.",1,"train_pos"
"you'll take more pics i don't write many reviews but i'm compelled to do so with this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"first and foremost, it will take better pic's than most film camera's.",1,"train_pos"
"save them on computer and print out just the ones who want.",1,"train_pos"
"duplicates are a no brainer and cheap.",1,"train_pos"
"no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic's for just a couple of keepers.",1,"train_pos"
"crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time.",1,"train_pos"
"the technology is finally here folks, to make your photo life easier.",1,"train_pos"
"a great new use for that underutilized computer.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you'll use all the time.",1,"train_pos"
"my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home, but now she's forever asking for the digital camera.",1,"train_pos"
"and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want, let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones (which are not many).",1,"train_pos"
"get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash.",1,"train_pos"
"in short, i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots.",1,"train_pos"
"i haven't used any of them since i got the g3.",1,"train_pos"
"unless your a professional, now you will need only one camera.",1,"train_pos"
"this one.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent camera i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras, and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera.",1,"train_pos"
"however, for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget, i think this camera is an excellent choice.",1,"train_pos"
"it has a beautiful design, lots of features, very easy to use, very configurable and customizable, and the battery duration is amazing!",1,"train_pos"
"also, the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions, or to protect it against any damage.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent idea!",1,"train_pos"
"however, it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras.",1,"train_pos"
"another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i've seen.",1,"train_pos"
"cannon i have owned this camera for a short time and wouldn't give it up for anything.",1,"train_pos"
"it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera..",1,"train_pos"
"powerful product bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations.",1,"train_pos"
"in general it is easy to use and well laid out.",1,"train_pos"
"it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography.",1,"train_pos"
"in the hands of someone who doesn't, it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode.",1,"train_pos"
"my wife, who has never used a camera before, picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you don't like what you have created you just delete and try again.",1,"train_pos"
"the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses!",1,"train_pos"
"this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3's large mobile screen helps with this.",1,"train_pos"
"go out and get a 256meg card, it's worth the expense.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful (and expensive) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography.",1,"train_pos"
"good points:  the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing.",1,"train_pos"
"canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out.",1,"train_pos"
"learning how to use it will not take very long.",1,"train_pos"
"the image quality is excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"messing around with images in photoshop (a supplied software package) and printing them on a good printer, yielded excellent results.",1,"train_pos"
"unless you are making posters, a g3 is more than good enough.",1,"train_pos"
"range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone: point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography.",1,"train_pos"
"please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used.",1,"train_pos"
"a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film.",1,"train_pos"
"i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first.",1,"train_pos"
"best camera i've used this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used.",1,"train_pos"
"it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box.",1,"train_pos"
"the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera is closest to perfect than any otherdigicam this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel.",1,"train_pos"
"beats that sony f717; its archrival.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology;  i can't fit all that resolution (4mp = 2272x 1704 resol.)",1,"train_pos"
"in my 19in flat monitor (1200x1024 resol.)",1,"train_pos"
"please go to read dpreview.com and you'll get the complete story.",1,"train_pos"
"the distortion is not a flaw.",1,"train_pos"
"in terms of the shots taken, this camera is insanely great!",1,"train_pos"
"the pictures are fabulous and their is a (short) learning curve to it; there are tons of features i haven't even gotten to.",1,"train_pos"
"in terms of the important accessories, i got myself an the extra litium battery.",1,"train_pos"
"based on my used, 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots.",1,"train_pos"
"i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash (enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash.",1,"train_pos"
"anyways, canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3.",1,"train_pos"
"it's a winner.",1,"train_pos"
"i've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow, car, boat and wind.",1,"train_pos"
"they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon's.",1,"train_pos"
"that's what i did and hopes this helps.",1,"train_pos"
"canon g3 review / response / recommendation the camera's a work of art / science -- that's understood.",1,"train_pos"
"it takes great pictures, operates quickly, and feels solid.",1,"train_pos"
"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews: (1) yes, the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder; however, the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder.",1,"train_pos"
"(2) there are, actually, several differences between the g2 and g3, such as differences in continuous shooting, the optical lens, the control layout, playback zoom, image processing, and so on.",1,"train_pos"
"everything else about the camera is great.",1,"train_pos"
"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder, i highly recommend the camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i love it more the longer i own it i've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control.",1,"train_pos"
"i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3, and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics (much more comfortable to hold and use) and the price.",1,"train_pos"
"i've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far.",1,"train_pos"
"and so far, i've been very pleased.",1,"train_pos"
"there's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures.",1,"train_pos"
"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.",1,"train_pos"
"the moveable lcd screen is great.",1,"train_pos"
"you can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself.",1,"train_pos"
"the tiny (postage-stamp sized) remote unit is wonderful: not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures.",1,"train_pos"
"i also purchased a good sturdy tripod: the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before.",1,"train_pos"
"the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit:  i chose the canon speedlite 420.  this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs: the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting.",1,"train_pos"
"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330, but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse:  i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery.",1,"train_pos"
"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras: the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery.",1,"train_pos"
"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options: shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear.",1,"train_pos"
"you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought a 512 mb card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution.",1,"train_pos"
"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files.",1,"train_pos"
"at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe's photoshop elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough.",1,"train_pos"
"if you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software!",1,"train_pos"
"and as i said in my review of the s330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers.",1,"train_pos"
"the bottom line: if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you.",1,"train_pos"
"but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time: you'll see the difference in your photos immediately.",1,"train_pos"
"added 2-24.  i've now had the camera for two months and i'm even more pleased with it.",1,"train_pos"
"i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.",1,"train_pos"
"it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings.",1,"train_pos"
"if you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.",1,"train_pos"
"i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter: the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker.",1,"train_pos"
"especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.",1,"train_pos"
"i did buy the telephoto lens (and the required extension).",1,"train_pos"
"very easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"i'll probably also get the wide-angle now, too.",1,"train_pos"
"very comfortable camera, easy to use, and the best digital photos you're going to get at this price.",1,"train_pos"
"best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels i've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it's advertised.",1,"train_pos"
"after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 (both of which lack the quality, feel, or features of the g3), i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality (resolution and coloration are superior).",1,"train_pos"
"it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life, enthusiast features, external flash capabilities, available storage types, image formats, and more.",1,"train_pos"
"this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features.",1,"train_pos"
"it can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it's finer features, i'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice.",1,"train_pos"
"all-in-all, i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market.",1,"train_pos"
"the best so far the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it, and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance (picture quality and battery life) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera.",1,"train_pos"
"canon's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better.",1,"train_pos"
"simply, the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point.",1,"train_pos"
"the canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the ibm microdrive (type ii compact flash), so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage.",1,"train_pos"
"for me on the fine resolution setting (not maximum but very close) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i've seen.",1,"train_pos"
"even with these shortcomings, i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200.",1,"train_pos"
"the best 4mp compact digital available this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer.",1,"train_pos"
"the pictures are razor-sharp, even in macro.",1,"train_pos"
"it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse.",1,"train_pos"
"it is light enough to carry around all day without bother.",1,"train_pos"
"operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i'm no annie lebovitz, but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store.",1,"train_pos"
"the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain.",1,"train_pos"
"the auto-focus performs well, but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof, and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera.",1,"train_pos"
"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit, included, is fast and small.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery, so it's good to go on a long vacation.",1,"train_pos"
"i enthusiastically recommend this camera.",1,"train_pos"
"perfect to grow into i got my camera three days back, and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one, i still rate myself as a beginner.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive.",1,"train_pos"
"it's easy to use, and yet very feature rich.",1,"train_pos"
"in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click, the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results.",1,"train_pos"
"the manual mode is feature rich and i can't wait to get the hang of it.",1,"train_pos"
"the macro mode is exceptional, the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery life is very good, i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time, the first time around, and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then, and have yet needed to recharge it.",1,"train_pos"
"near perfection i love photography.",1,"train_pos"
"i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera.",1,"train_pos"
"i needed something with more power, so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300.  i fell in love with this camera, it combines ease of use, with an immense amount of options and power.",1,"train_pos"
"you can use the scene modes, or fine tune the options, i. you can change the iso level, shutter speed, etc.",1,"train_pos"
"this camera is ideal for people who want more power, but don't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera.",1,"train_pos"
"the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing.",1,"train_pos"
"i've had no problem with canon whatsoever.",1,"train_pos"
"card reader is included.",1,"train_pos"
"i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar.",1,"train_pos"
"only "" cons "" here the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera, which i do agree.",1,"train_pos"
"go; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card.",1,"train_pos"
"but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity; an exceptional close-up shooting capability.",1,"train_pos"
"i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix.",1,"train_pos"
"and labor!",1,"train_pos"
"otherwise, it takes very good pictures; shutter delay isn't so bad either.",1,"train_pos"
"amazing camera i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world.",1,"train_pos"
"nikon 4300, i feel, is the best camera out there for the features and price.",1,"train_pos"
"here were my requirements in a digital camera:  1. i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while.",1,"train_pos"
"i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily.",1,"train_pos"
"3. i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although, i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings.",1,"train_pos"
"4. and, of course, i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but hadn't used it much.",1,"train_pos"
"depending on all the above requirements, i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models.",1,"train_pos"
"nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes, medium; compact size, price, brand name, good software that is included and previous reviews.",1,"train_pos"
"i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since.",1,"train_pos"
"the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details.",1,"train_pos"
"all the above, i think, are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints.",1,"train_pos"
"and finally, get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness.",1,"train_pos"
"hope this review has helped you in making up your mind.",1,"train_pos"
"i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience.",1,"train_pos"

"i first intended to buy the 3100, but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300.  the lense is a lot better, and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures.",1,"train_pos"
"the possibilities with auto, manual, and the very helpful "" scene "" mode, which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait, landscape, beach / snow, sunset etc., are endless.",1,"train_pos"
"the movie mode is also working great.",1,"train_pos"
"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem, battery charger, usb and video cable.",1,"train_pos"
"a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution.",1,"train_pos"
"i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers, and they both delivered great results.",1,"train_pos"
"even at the "" normal "" setting, a 8x10 print!",1,"train_pos"
"shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "".",1,"train_pos"
"i therefore bought a second battery as a backup, and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger, which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe, we ran never out of "" juice "".",1,"train_pos"
"i highly recommend the accessory kit, which provides you with everything else you need:  a nice camera bag, which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger.",1,"train_pos"
"furher it contains a card reader, a flash card folder for up to 8 cards, a lense cleaning rag, and an ac adapter, which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "".",1,"train_pos"

"after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures.",1,"train_pos"
"the digital zoom takes as good of pictures, as the optical zoom does!",1,"train_pos"
"the inside pics, can be a bit challenging, but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like, that are not focused perfectly, or need lighting adjustments, make this camera very simple and effective.",1,"train_pos"

"sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning, and the evening!",1,"train_pos"

"beginner looks experienced with coolpix this is a wonderful camera.",1,"train_pos"
"in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer's remorse.",1,"train_pos"
"4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera, 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price.",1,"train_pos"

"the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away.",1,"train_pos"
"the shutter lag is on par with what i've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more.",1,"train_pos"

"the regular mode in this camera works for 80% of settings.",1,"train_pos"
"the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting.",1,"train_pos"

"i have had the phone for 1 week, the signal quality has been great in the detroit area (suburbs) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky (cincinnati) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75, far superior to at &amp;#38; t's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route.",1,"train_pos"
"i have owned motorola, panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia, this phone combines many of the best nokia features, the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition.",1,"train_pos"

"t-mobile is trying very hard, and again -- they do have pretty good csr's.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm staying with sprint, and though i fear that their csr isn't nearly as good as t-mobile's, the clarity of their reception is exceptional.",1,"train_pos"

"it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls.",1,"train_pos"

"great speakerphone and great reception!!",1,"train_pos"
"reccomend!",1,"train_pos"
"the title says it all...  the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make...  only con i can think of is no camera....  no big deal for the size..  this phone is a winner...",1,"train_pos"
"perfect.",1,"train_pos"
"anything this phone does, it does perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"the speakerphone, the radio, all features work perfectly.",1,"train_pos"

"the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"the radio:  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in.",1,"train_pos"
"this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio, but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone's radio should work perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"tri-band:  one highly beneficial feature of this phone (at least to me) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm, a few in asia.",1,"train_pos"
"i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception.",1,"train_pos"
"if it worked like that in south africa, i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe.",1,"train_pos"

"this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones.",1,"train_pos"
"or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store, which are located in many countries in europe.",1,"train_pos"
"i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service.",1,"train_pos"
"able to use service in another country:  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time, you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country.",1,"train_pos"
"you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country.",1,"train_pos"
"size and weight:  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there; it is unbelievably small and oh, so light.",1,"train_pos"
"this is a benefit for many reasons; one being just for appearance, your pants won't be bulging with this phone in your pocket.",1,"train_pos"
"battery life:  the battery life on this phone is surreal.",1,"train_pos"
"it lasts, truly, 7 days on standby.",1,"train_pos"

"it works... as a phone!",1,"train_pos"
"perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review, but i actually mean it in earnest.",1,"train_pos"
"i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling, but definitely more functional device.",1,"train_pos"
"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department, it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do: to be a wireless telephone.",1,"train_pos"
"the reception and sound quality are top-notch.",1,"train_pos"
"i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs, which is an unaccustomed luxury, even with t-mobile service.",1,"train_pos"
"i like the size and weight of this little critter.",1,"train_pos"

"it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones.",1,"train_pos"

"below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends:  sound quality:  the most important thing for me is sound quality.",1,"train_pos"
"nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception.",1,"train_pos"
"i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone, the motorolla t720 series, and the sony ericsson t610 series.",1,"train_pos"

"overall design:  i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets.",1,"train_pos"
"of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest.",1,"train_pos"
"the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small.",1,"train_pos"

"all these phones have color screens, polymorphic tones, and are internet ready.",1,"train_pos"
"in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords (thats number of different instruments which it can play) i think, the samsung i think have 15, i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones.",1,"train_pos"
"oh well..  overall this is a slightly better than average phone.",1,"train_pos"
"both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610.  personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more.",1,"train_pos"
"i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year.",1,"train_pos"
"if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610.",1,"train_pos"
"they are all free if you get a new account anyway, but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling.",1,"train_pos"

"you can do * so * much more with the pc suite, i.e.",1,"train_pos"

"the phone's sound quality is great (turn up the volume if its too quiet, people, this thing will get loud) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing.",1,"train_pos"

"the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there.",1,"train_pos"
"one thing that i found out recently is that you don't need t-zones from tmobile to go online.",1,"train_pos"
"anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net, being able to download pics and ringtones (not java apps, you need t-zones for that).",1,"train_pos"
"tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans.",1,"train_pos"
"if you thought about getting this phone buy it.",1,"train_pos"
"this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities.",1,"train_pos"
"6610 = great phone and a few extras i am a person that needs my phone (s) on demand.",1,"train_pos"
"i currrently have service with t-mobile, verizon, and t-mobile.",1,"train_pos"
"the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering!",1,"train_pos"
"very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for, and one that has not yet been mentioned: using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port!",1,"train_pos"
"using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account.",1,"train_pos"
"yes it is 56k speed, but the functionality is what you are paying for.",1,"train_pos"
"i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable (49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com) press dial up on my laptop (by the way it is a mac pb 1gz.",1,"train_pos"
"and in a matter of seconds i can access my email, fax, and the entire web from my truck!",1,"train_pos"
"i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "".",1,"train_pos"
"it does well in all aspects of internet browsing.",1,"train_pos"
"as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it.",1,"train_pos"
"the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon &amp; t-mobile and nokia.",1,"train_pos"
"the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone.",1,"train_pos"
"my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset.",1,"train_pos"
"i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones.",1,"train_pos"
"battery life is good for a phone of this size.",1,"train_pos"
"but anyway, the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing.",1,"train_pos"
"great screen and great sound.",1,"train_pos"
"the 6610 excels as a cell phone, thank god.",1,"train_pos"
"the voice quality is very good, and it gets great reception (that is, in places where you get t-mobile coverage, which is not that good; see below).",1,"train_pos"
"the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright, and commands are very responsive.",1,"train_pos"
"(to be fair, the same can be said about many korean imports, and the nokia's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans.)",1,"train_pos"
"other than that, this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips.",1,"train_pos"
"great phone, great service, no voice dialing.",1,"train_pos"
"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone, and what a great phone it is.",1,"train_pos"
"after using it, i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket.",1,"train_pos"
"it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder, but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included.",1,"train_pos"
"the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all, unless dialing a number.",1,"train_pos"
"unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming.",1,"train_pos"
"when i turned the phone on, the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is.",1,"train_pos"
"the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable!",1,"train_pos"
"the phone has several color schemes you can choose from.",1,"train_pos"
"i like the default blue.",1,"train_pos"
"you can also set a background wallpaper.",1,"train_pos"
"the ringtones included are awesome, and did i mention they were polyphonic?",1,"train_pos"

"you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call.",1,"train_pos"
"the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries, with multiple phone number per entry, so you can program your boss's home, work and cellphone numbers all under one contact.",1,"train_pos"
"the phone also sports an image gallery (with option camera attachment), a calendar / organizer, alarm clock with snooze, fm radio (way cool, even if it is just through an ear-peice), games, java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection.",1,"train_pos"
"you can get weather, movies, horoscopes and more with a few clicks.",1,"train_pos"
"the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code, but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go.",1,"train_pos"
"i have been assured this will be fixed soon.",1,"train_pos"
"now, for the t-mobile service:  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones.",1,"train_pos"
"if you have a question, they have the answer.",1,"train_pos"
"and should they not know it, they can find it out pretty quick.",1,"train_pos"
"every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone.",1,"train_pos"
"all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved.",1,"train_pos"
"i'd like to see my old carrier do that!",1,"train_pos"
"the rate plans are also very good, at least for me.",1,"train_pos"
"different people have different needs, of course, but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive.",1,"train_pos"
"the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked.",1,"train_pos"
"this phone is highly recommended otherwise.",1,"train_pos"
"nokia makes a great phone, that's clear.",1,"train_pos"
"with all its complicated features, the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great.",1,"train_pos"
"one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe, etc.",1,"train_pos"
"a good phone.",1,"train_pos"
"this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it.",1,"train_pos"
"the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution.",1,"train_pos"
"it is very light weight and has a good signal strength.",1,"train_pos"
"but, i would definately recommend this phone.",1,"train_pos"
"go for it...",1,"train_pos"
"while, there are flaws with the machine, the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability.",1,"train_pos"
"it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there.",1,"train_pos"
"like it's predecessor, the quickly revised nx, this player boasts a decent size and weight, a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags, and excellent sound (widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business).",1,"train_pos"
"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger, now-blue backlit screen, which is infinitely better.",1,"train_pos"
"further, the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3.",1,"train_pos"
"this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties.",1,"train_pos"
"get this player!",1,"train_pos"
"before i decided to get this player, i did my research.",1,"train_pos"
"i looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player.",1,"train_pos"
"i chose this one because from what i read, it was the best deal for the money.",1,"train_pos"
"another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it.",1,"train_pos"
"that takes up half the space of mp3's.",1,"train_pos"
"that's important because i have a lot of music.",1,"train_pos"
"the software is great.",1,"train_pos"
"you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories.",1,"train_pos"
"transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy.",1,"train_pos"
"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good.",1,"train_pos"
"they player's interface itself is also very easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"can't complain and i recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon.",1,"train_pos"
"get it, it's woth every penny!",1,"train_pos"
"!",1,"train_pos"
"i've had it for a week now, don't regret the purchase one bit, and i never leave home without it.",1,"train_pos"
"if you have any doubts about this player, well don't.",1,"train_pos"
"pros:  software is easy to use (although redhat software is better, but costs money)  much cheaper than i-pod good looking player (beautiful blue back-lit screen) if you've read about the player, some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on, but this is good because the face doesn't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate  no issues as of yet  cons:  you're going to need to buy new headphones, the stock ones suck  hopefully, this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound is the thing!",1,"train_pos"
"for me the sound of the music is what is important.",1,"train_pos"
"the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s.",1,"train_pos"
"navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well.",1,"train_pos"
"at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery is replaceable (a real plus) and there is a leather case (another real plus).",1,"train_pos"
"i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music.",1,"train_pos"
"so far the software for the pc works easily.",1,"train_pos"
"by the way, it looks nice also.",1,"train_pos"
"an ipod killer: this thing kicks mighty apple butt!",1,"train_pos"
"i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can't, i'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars.",1,"train_pos"
"it's worth it.",1,"train_pos"
"after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player, i knew i had found what i was looking for.",1,"train_pos"
"my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price: i found both.",1,"train_pos"
"this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time.",1,"train_pos"
"the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size, so you have to wonder just how much apple's markup is anyway!",1,"train_pos"
"the sound is excellent, but a tip: get a real pair of headphones.",1,"train_pos"
"you won't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.",1,"train_pos"
"the controls are on the side instead of on the front, which i like, because that's where my thumb is when i hold the thing!",1,"train_pos"
"the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad.",1,"train_pos"
"it could be a little bit bigger, but it's easy to get used to.",1,"train_pos"
"the screen may be a little smaller, but it is very readable and doesn't come in the overused blue.",1,"train_pos"
"(i would have appreciated having a firewire plug, however)  the included leather pouch is a big plus: it actually protects the unit well, something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices.",1,"train_pos"
"other plusses: changable battery, loads of presets for environments, decent construction, still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"(did i mention you can actually change the battery?",1,"train_pos"
"since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment, aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make.",1,"train_pos"
"overall: small, sounds great, and less expensive than apple's overpriced ipod!",1,"train_pos"
"(batteries last longer too!)",1,"train_pos"
"way better than a i-pod!",1,"train_pos"
"i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player, and all i heard was how good the i-pod was.",1,"train_pos"
"the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player.",1,"train_pos"
"i've had it for about 2 weeks and it's the best player i've seen, and used, ever.",1,"train_pos"
"the music is easy to get to (all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online, then you can do the same with the zen.",1,"train_pos"
"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night, but dim enough so it doesn't blind you when you stare too long.",1,"train_pos"
"all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away, with easy to use and understand features, software that is simple to understand and use, and a great sound (which is all that matters in a mp3 player).",1,"train_pos"
"just get some new headphones and your set.",1,"train_pos"
"great product for a windows computer.",1,"train_pos"
"within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files.",1,"train_pos"
"it's a very intuitive program.",1,"train_pos"
"i had no problems following their installation instructions.",1,"train_pos"
"the menus are very easy to navigate.",1,"train_pos"
"the other controls are all very easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"it has several play options, one of the best is an option to shuffle, based on all or a certain playlist.",1,"train_pos"
"unlike the ipod, this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box.",1,"train_pos"
"it also costs a lot less than the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the earbuds that come with it aren't that bad.",1,"train_pos"
"they're pretty comfortable, stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality.",1,"train_pos"
"this is a good deal for music and data storage.",1,"train_pos"
"one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day, so there are many options i have not explored.",1,"train_pos"
"with the nomad explorer software, songs should be drag-and-drop.",1,"train_pos"
"on the positive side, the sound of the player is pretty good, once you have everything configured.",1,"train_pos"
"i haven't had time to really push this player to the limit, but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory, as should be expected from creative labs.",1,"train_pos"
"great player.",1,"train_pos"
"when it came down to it, the price on this player is hard to beat.",1,"train_pos"
"if you want the other accessories the ipod offer, maybe that's where you should go...  this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds.",1,"train_pos"
"i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me.",1,"train_pos"
"other than that this thing is great...  enjoy!",1,"train_pos"
"replaceable battery lets zennx keep running and running.",1,"train_pos"
"zennx's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery, just like any other battery-powered appliance.",1,"train_pos"
"notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx.",1,"train_pos"
"the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement, but the toggle switch is still tricky.",1,"train_pos"
"zennx's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ($ 10/gig)) trumps ipod's 30g model ($ 14/gig).",1,"train_pos"
"choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx's rechargeable battery.",1,"train_pos"
"zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery.",1,"train_pos"
"update: apple recently announced that for $ 107, it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory.",1,"train_pos"
"lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings, so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage.",1,"train_pos"
"terrific mp3 player, great price.",1,"train_pos"
"i love my new nomad, its great!",1,"train_pos"
"now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i'm going to want to listen to biking home.",1,"train_pos"
"for some this might be a problem, but for the price of a 30 gig ipod, you can get a 60gb nomad, the ipod simply pales in comparison.",1,"train_pos"
"the software is very easy to use, and within 30 minutes of opening my box, i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds.",1,"train_pos"
"the free (i didnt know they still did that) carrying case is really protective, and to me its the only accessory you need (except good headphones).",1,"train_pos"
"on the subject of headphones, this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box, but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof!",1,"train_pos"
"if you want a sexy, cool, accessory-availible mp3 player, by all means, get an ipod for a hundred dollars more (or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music).",1,"train_pos"
"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player, get the nomad.",1,"train_pos"
"best electronic i've bought since i was born.",1,"train_pos"
"impressed!",1,"train_pos"
"for an early christmas gift, i got a zen xtra 40 gb player.",1,"train_pos"
"this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type.",1,"train_pos"
"after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player...  i will just say this:  i will never go back to my archos again!!",1,"train_pos"
"so easy to set up, had some problems with my archos.",1,"train_pos"
"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking, by artist, song title, genre, etc.",1,"train_pos"
"not only is it functional and runs super smooth &amp; fast, but it is also eye candy.",1,"train_pos"
"very sleek &amp; stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has.",1,"train_pos"
"the leather case it comes with is pretty nice, similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly.",1,"train_pos"
"all the buttons &amp; neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound quality is also nice... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with.",1,"train_pos"
"lots of sound options, has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options.",1,"train_pos"
"navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch.",1,"train_pos"
"also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player.",1,"train_pos"
"oh, and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^  another plus in my book, no file limits!",1,"train_pos"
"i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os, now i can have as many as i want.",1,"train_pos"
"i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up.",1,"train_pos"
"i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder.",1,"train_pos"
"now i can transport files to friends house with ease.",1,"train_pos"
"when plugged in, it doesn't lag the computer like the archos did... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load.",1,"train_pos"
"after playing with this little device, i don't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price!",1,"train_pos"
"i really have no complaints over this unit.",1,"train_pos"
"i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player.",1,"train_pos"
"in fact, my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing.",1,"train_pos"
"fantastic piece of machinery.",1,"train_pos"
"i have no complaints with this mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"getting files onto it is quick and painless.",1,"train_pos"
"then sorting the files is easy as pie.",1,"train_pos"
"and it holds sooooo much music and audio files.",1,"train_pos"
"my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems.",1,"train_pos"
"also, the sound is wonderful... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery is nice.",1,"train_pos"
"i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them.",1,"train_pos"
"the lcd screen was very large and readable.",1,"train_pos"
"thank you!",1,"train_pos"
"a great buy.",1,"train_pos"
"compared to everything else in this category, this is most definately the best bang for the buck.",1,"train_pos"
"i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced, but it's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods (although, the ipod is still way over priced).",1,"train_pos"
"all of the zens use a standard notebook drive.",1,"train_pos"
"this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players (the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive).",1,"train_pos"
"i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as (and better in some areas) the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400.  that's a huge difference... especially in this price range.",1,"train_pos"
"i gave the zen 5 stars because it's excellent for the class that it is in and it's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class.",1,"train_pos"
"my personal favorite is the karma (i currently own a karma, a zen usb 2.0, a philips hdd100, and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder).",1,"train_pos"
"ipod vs nomad zen xtra i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"song transfers were not an issue.",1,"train_pos"
"i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire.",1,"train_pos"
"the navigion on it can be a little quirky, but still operates better than the zen's did.",1,"train_pos"
"the ipod is also an attractable piece, being lightweight and small.",1,"train_pos"
"the casing scratches a little easy, but the glove cases work great to protect against this.",1,"train_pos"
"sound quality was the same between the two, but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features.",1,"train_pos"
"i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase.",1,"train_pos"
"granted it is a little more than the zen, it is well worth it.",1,"train_pos"
"itunes is a versatile program and i haven't had any issues with the ipod itself.",1,"train_pos"
"wonderful.",1,"train_pos"
"i love this player.",1,"train_pos"
"its great.",1,"train_pos"
"i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again.",1,"train_pos"
"the software was great, as long as you have an adminstrative user account (windows xp).",1,"train_pos"
"i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so.",1,"train_pos"
"it only took about 30 minutes to download everything, and that was about 950 songs.",1,"train_pos"
"anyway, this player is a great deal and i really love it.",1,"train_pos"
"a good product.",1,"train_pos"
"the pro...  way less expensive than the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"my opinions:  personally, i don't understand all the complaints about the interface...  i find it pretty easy to use... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx (on the pc)...  it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list.",1,"train_pos"
"meaning i don't have to manually clear the list, and then load the new list.",1,"train_pos"
"sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly (maybe this applies to other players too, and not just the nomad, i don't know).",1,"train_pos"
"i would've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand.",1,"train_pos"
"not counting the time i spent editing the songs (i suppose i should've done it anyway on my pc) the transfer was pretty painless.",1,"train_pos"
"once you start sending files, it'll continue until it's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song... at which point you can skip, skip all, replace, replace all, or cancel.",1,"train_pos"
"and go from there... if you chose one of the "" all "" options, then you don't need to do anything until it's done.",1,"train_pos"
"in two transfer batches (first was english songs, then foreign languages), it didn't come up with any errors (aside the duplicate name i mentioned).",1,"train_pos"
"so i don't know what the previous review that couldn't do more than 30 songs is talking about.",1,"train_pos"
"of course, unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23.",1,"train_pos"
"00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too.",1,"train_pos"
"you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.",1,"train_pos"
"so far, it's sweet.",1,"train_pos"
"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago, and so far it has been excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"i still have over 19gb left, and already have over 200 cd's on it.",1,"train_pos"
"i'll have to borrow cd's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad, or the software that comes with the unit.",1,"train_pos"
"both are very easy to learn &amp; use, and intuitive enough for even a novice.",1,"train_pos"
"besides user error (surprise, surprise), it's hard to imagine people having trouble with either.",1,"train_pos"
"ripping &amp; transferring tunes is basic, and pretty fast (even on a 1.1 usb).",1,"train_pos"
"people also have complained about the case not having a window, but that's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection.",1,"train_pos"
"it's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you're listening to.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound quality is excellent (and i'm fussy with that stuff), the unit looks cool, screen is bright and easy to read, and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod (besides the price, but everyone knows that).",1,"train_pos"
"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well (sound presets, navigating options, playlists, etc).",1,"train_pos"
"i just put it on "" shuffle "", sit back, and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer!",1,"train_pos"
"not an urgent issue, as it still works...  all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well.",1,"train_pos"
"but i've already emailed creative tech support about it, and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary...  we'll see if i need them to.",1,"train_pos"
"it still fits in the palm of your hand, and it's not heavy.",1,"train_pos"
"i use mine at the office, in the car (with a cassette adapter), and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday.",1,"train_pos"
"yes.",1,"train_pos"
"rip your tunes at 192kb if you like, alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy, and you'll get more tunes stored on it.",1,"train_pos"
"bottom line... great product, unbeatable price.",1,"train_pos"
"i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb (got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa... thanks amazon!)",1,"train_pos"
"i got it now, and i'm diggin ' it.",1,"train_pos"
"bummer as it has great sound quality.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent product.",1,"train_pos"
"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i'm extremely pleased with it.",1,"train_pos"
"the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go.",1,"train_pos"
"so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift.",1,"train_pos"
"the setup and transfer process was cake for me.",1,"train_pos"
"i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player.",1,"train_pos"
"i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it wasn't a big problem.",1,"train_pos"
"it was always after it finished a process or something, so it didn't cause any file errors.",1,"train_pos"
"now that i have all my music on it there hasn't been any more problems.",1,"train_pos"
"the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it.",1,"train_pos"
"i haven't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can't comment on any problems there.",1,"train_pos"
"the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides.",1,"train_pos"
"all in all though i'm very happy with my new mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"i'll admit that i'd own an ipod if i had money to burn, but for the money this is a much better buy.",1,"train_pos"
"highly recommended!",1,"train_pos"
"fantasic product.",1,"train_pos"
"i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic!",1,"train_pos"
"this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver.",1,"train_pos"
"i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy.",1,"train_pos"
"if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album &amp; song id information (this is a free service) with the click of a button.",1,"train_pos"
"ripping your songs and creating playlists couldn't be any easier.",1,"train_pos"
"i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer.",1,"train_pos"
"just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it's done!",1,"train_pos"
"being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable.",1,"train_pos"
"when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it's that good!",1,"train_pos"
"the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior.",1,"train_pos"
"actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated.",1,"train_pos"
"finding a particular song (s) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy.",1,"train_pos"
"i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd.",1,"train_pos"
"the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight.",1,"train_pos"
"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use (hardware and software), playback quality and value for the price.",1,"train_pos"
"good value.",1,"train_pos"
"just bought one &amp; i've enjoyed it to date.",1,"train_pos"
"nice palm sized unit, somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you're not going to try &amp; jog with it or something.",1,"train_pos"
"all reviews i've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed (ipod, archos, dell, samsung).",1,"train_pos"
"red chair's notmad explorer is great &amp; recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software.",1,"train_pos"
"note: this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase, but worth it  likes  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price  - best in class sound  - large easy readable screen",1,"train_pos"
"at this time, i decided to turn the player on, and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music, one of which is a childhood favorite, bach's air.",1,"train_pos"
"wonderful.",1,"train_pos"
"charged my battery.",1,"train_pos"
"plugged it in.",1,"train_pos"
"installed software.",1,"train_pos"
"started ripping and transferring.",1,"train_pos"
"if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff, but that little work will save you looking for songs.",1,"train_pos"
"i've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go.",1,"train_pos"
"working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks!!",1,"train_pos"
"i love it!",1,"train_pos"
"!",1,"train_pos"
"good player, but this technology is not yet great.",1,"train_pos"
"i received this as a gift.",1,"train_pos"
"i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd's transferred.",1,"train_pos"
"transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0.  it is great sounding, even with the supplied earbuds.",1,"train_pos"
"i must have differing preferences than others here, as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony's that i thought sounded good on other players.",1,"train_pos"
"i love the storage in this thing.",1,"train_pos"
"i have 100 of my cd's transferred and haven't made a dent in the 30 gb drive.",1,"train_pos"
"i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity, but you never know.",1,"train_pos"
"this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3's in which i would have never purchased the cd.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent product.",1,"train_pos"
"this is my second creative labs mp3 player, and it is definitely a fine product.",1,"train_pos"
"3. that's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives, and the negatives aren't that bad.",1,"train_pos"
"first of all the player's sound quality is superior to the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the player's software is very easy to use and very good.",1,"train_pos"
"compared to musicmatch, the software has a better filing system and easier to use.",1,"train_pos"
"to keep it short, this is cheaper, and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"if you purchase this product, definitely rip your songs through windows media player.",1,"train_pos"
"this thing seriously is a good player though.",1,"train_pos"
"another electronics fan.",1,"train_pos"
"summary  overall i like the unit.",1,"train_pos"
"if it were not for that i would have given it 4.  pros:  1) price / gb of storage  2) storage capacity  3) user replaceable battery  cons:  1) fragile (i broke the 1st one within 10 days)  2) scroll button / switch  3) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing.",1,"train_pos"
"2) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo.",1,"train_pos"
"they sell an adapter unit to use with your car's cassette deck.",1,"train_pos"
"i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature.",1,"train_pos"
"overall i like it.",1,"train_pos"
"updating the unit's firmware:  when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website.",1,"train_pos"
"the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions.",1,"train_pos"
"i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation.",1,"train_pos"
"storage:  the storage capacity is great.",1,"train_pos"
"i don't think i will ever use the full 30gb.",1,"train_pos"
"i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i haven't even used 10gb of storage yet.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm starting to listen to cd's that i haven't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place.",1,"train_pos"
"for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding, you can encode your cd's at varying quality levels.",1,"train_pos"
"the higher the number the better the quality (less data compression is used) and the larger the file size.",1,"train_pos"
"you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player.",1,"train_pos"
"price:  the price compared to the ipod is great.",1,"train_pos"
"price, along with the replaceable battery (which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad.",1,"train_pos"
"software:  i've had no problems with the software.",1,"train_pos"
"i found it intuitive to use (i didn't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes).",1,"train_pos"
"the software will convert your cd's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to.",1,"train_pos"
"my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly (i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd).",1,"train_pos"
"through the software you can classify songs in genres.",1,"train_pos"
"this is a nice feature (i.e.",1,"train_pos"
"it's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem.",1,"train_pos"
"the software comes with plenty of defaults genres.",1,"train_pos"
"you can also create your own if you don't like their classifications.",1,"train_pos"
"you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later.",1,"train_pos"
"this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass.",1,"train_pos"
"in addition, you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player.",1,"train_pos"
"this is pretty cool.",1,"train_pos"
"i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base.",1,"train_pos"
"it's probably good for the health of your ears, however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range (and my hearing is fine).",1,"train_pos"
"wow, dennis sure is great!",1,"train_pos"
"this thing is great, i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records.",1,"train_pos"
"i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on, but creative did a good job with this, as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years.",1,"train_pos"
"anyway, im gon na go find dennis now, have a nice day!!",1,"train_pos"
"!",1,"train_pos"
"it is ok, but... i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago.",1,"train_pos"
"i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra.",1,"train_pos"
"one good thing, it is 40 gb of disk space (well, it is 38 gb in reality).",1,"train_pos"
"for the price and features it is really good.",1,"train_pos"
"support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes.",1,"train_pos"
"notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product.",1,"train_pos"
"transfer files is easy using notmad, however again, would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver, rca lyra and some other.",1,"train_pos"
"after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive, so better organization is required.",1,"train_pos"
"i downloaded the trial version, and after less than 10 minutes of using it, decided it was well worth the price.",1,"train_pos"
"for once, though, this 3rd party software is excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind.",1,"train_pos"
"zens rule.",1,"train_pos"
"unmatched quality and beyond cool.",1,"train_pos"
"i like the way apple is innovative, but let's face it - they can't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long, especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod.",1,"train_pos"
"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks, spills my beer, but doesn't wash my car.",1,"train_pos"
"longer battery life, greater accessibility to online music services, and pc compatibility are the sensibilities.",1,"train_pos"
"the visceral teases include the case, the sound quality, and the capacity.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields.",1,"train_pos"
"creative thinking.",1,"train_pos"
"i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent, and finally the price, $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod, is excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style, size, and ease of use.",1,"train_pos"
"the nomad is not ugly, it is not that big, it comfortably fits in my pocket, or heavy, and the controls are not hard to get used to.",1,"train_pos"
"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance, also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing.",1,"train_pos"
"i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering.",1,"train_pos"
"thank you very much, and go out and get yourself a nomad!",1,"train_pos"
"got to get an ipod!",1,"train_pos"
"of course you do!",1,"train_pos"
"i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift.",1,"train_pos"

"otherwise, this player is awesome!",1,"train_pos"
"it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily.",1,"train_pos"
"the volume range is great, so you can blast it if you want.",1,"train_pos"
"overall, this player is awesome and i definately recommend it.",1,"train_pos"
"perfect purchase.",1,"train_pos"
"i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards.",1,"train_pos"
"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing (i recomend www.nomadness.net), and price-wise zens are unbeatable.",1,"train_pos"
"compared to other leading hdd mp3 players, the value per gb is the tops.",1,"train_pos"
"- sound quality: excellent, everything you would expect from this company.",1,"train_pos"
"- the unit is easy to use and intuitive.",1,"train_pos"
"it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls.",1,"train_pos"
"- uploading music is quick and easy.",1,"train_pos"
"although the supplied software can be annoying at times, on whole it is excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty.",1,"train_pos"
"(it's fast too!)",1,"train_pos"
"btw, be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly, as this will ensure a great organization.",1,"train_pos"
"- the unit itself its well structured, with just the buttons you need and none you don't.",1,"train_pos"
"as often mentioned, the scroll tab is average, however, not difficult to use or horrible.",1,"train_pos"
"structurally, everything is secure and it won't fall apart on you.",1,"train_pos"
"the screen is large, defined, and easy to read, and the silver unit is naturally cool.",1,"train_pos"
"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax, and customization.",1,"train_pos"
"- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out (as all lithium batteries do), you will be able to buy another easily.",1,"train_pos"
"also, the nomad's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy.",1,"train_pos"
"- equipment included is average, but that isn't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for.",1,"train_pos"
"conclusion:  this player is an ideal purchase.",1,"train_pos"
"there isn't need to get in details again, but just remember it rocks because: price, sound, ease of use, and features.",1,"train_pos"
"i would recogmend this player to anyone i know, and you will not be dissapointed.",1,"train_pos"
"impressive with few flaws.",1,"train_pos"
"the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt.",1,"train_pos"
"i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player.",1,"train_pos"
"i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic.",1,"train_pos"
"so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost.",1,"train_pos"
"awesome.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm very pleased with my zx so here's a quick review.",1,"train_pos"
"it is small overall, bigger than the ipod, but keep in mind that this is because different, less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx.",1,"train_pos"
"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod, however it compromises a bit of the unit's size in doing so.",1,"train_pos"
"the lcd is larger than the previous model, the nx, and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx's green backlight did.",1,"train_pos"
"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me, however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product.",1,"train_pos"
"the included eax support is useful at times, especially when you listen to a variety of genres, as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle.",1,"train_pos"
"the signal to noise ratio (the ratio of detectable, useful data to unusable garbage in, say, a radio wave; a larger stn ratio is better) is nice and high at 98 decibles, and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods.",1,"train_pos"
"the software hasn't been a hassle for me at all.",1,"train_pos"
"i ignored the instruction booklet (as i do with any product) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes.",1,"train_pos"
"my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well, and she is of average computer competence.",1,"train_pos"
"the less computer-saavy might find apple's software a bit friendlier, though (i use it at a friend's house and it does do a lot more for you.)",1,"train_pos"
"lastly, the price is fantastic:  i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx, compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120.",1,"train_pos"
"if you want great sound quality, don't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte, don't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users, and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount, then i would suggest the zen xtra for you.",1,"train_pos"
"it's pretty good.",1,"train_pos"
"(i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead).",1,"train_pos"
"eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs (reviewers figures)  i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems.",1,"train_pos"
"transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds.",1,"train_pos"
"it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds.",1,"train_pos"
"but the sound is very good (and loud) and works well on my portable speakers.",1,"train_pos"
"and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world (and is quite small).",1,"train_pos"
"it looks very cool, and seems quite small to me and very light.",1,"train_pos"
"the scroll button seems ok, i have no problems with it.",1,"train_pos"
"i am very pleased so far.",1,"train_pos"
"i had all my files already on my pc in wma format (200 cd's).",1,"train_pos"
"so far so good, no problems, no conversions.",1,"train_pos"
"very simple to use.",1,"train_pos"
"the reason it does not get 5 stars  1) a spare battery would have been great.",1,"train_pos"
"2) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it.",1,"train_pos"
"3) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer, like some players  all in all suprisingly easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"a great player for the price.",1,"train_pos"
"summary:  lots of flaws, but exceptional sound quality, hd size, and price make it a good buy.",1,"train_pos"
"pros:  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox.",1,"train_pos"
"there was no distortion and it sounded great, especially with eax environmental audio enabled.",1,"train_pos"
"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk, so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad.",1,"train_pos"
"i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software.",1,"train_pos"
"the nomad can hold any type of file, not just mp3, so you can use it as a portable hard disk.",1,"train_pos"
"i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer.",1,"train_pos"
"this almost made it worth the price alone.",1,"train_pos"
"i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer, and then transfer them to a friend's.",1,"train_pos"
"huge storage space - even at 320kbs, you can store a ton of songs on this thing.",1,"train_pos"
"30gb is more than enough for most people.",1,"train_pos"
"having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers.",1,"train_pos"
"it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file.",1,"train_pos"
"it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs.",1,"train_pos"
"this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags, and if you've downloaded your songs off the internet, many probably don't.",1,"train_pos"
"whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox, it dumps all of them into a single folder, and then sorts them by the id3 tags.",1,"train_pos"
"that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether.",1,"train_pos"
"the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable.",1,"train_pos"
"i use it for ripping cds, which it does a pretty good job of.",1,"train_pos"
"i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer, "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet.",1,"train_pos"
"the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack.",1,"train_pos"
"case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case.",1,"train_pos"
"that way i could keep it in the case all the time.",1,"train_pos"
"overall, i feel that it's a decent buy, and am happy that i own it.",1,"train_pos"
"i am willing to overlook it's problems to get superior sound quality and low price, although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement.",1,"train_pos"
"after looking over multiple large mp3 players, i decided to get this one.",1,"train_pos"
"for the price and size and features, you can't beat the price.",1,"train_pos"
"i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection, whihc is a plus, but then again it is only speculation.",1,"train_pos"
"the buttons and interface are very easy to use.",1,"train_pos"
"simple click buttons, back buttons volume and display are very easy to read, access and use.",1,"train_pos"
"buy this for the storage and price, avoid it if you know nothing about computers.",1,"train_pos"
"buy this instead of an ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "".",1,"train_pos"
"i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer.",1,"train_pos"
"also the ipod has games on it.",1,"train_pos"
"games are ok for a cell phone, but mp3's are for music.",1,"train_pos"
"this thing roxxorz.",1,"train_pos"
"i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on.",1,"train_pos"
"i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway.",1,"train_pos"
"i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product.",1,"train_pos"
"the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery life seems good, takes very lttle time to charge, it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs.",1,"train_pos"
"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation, but it's a very user friendly player imo.",1,"train_pos"
"i haven't messed with the firmware at all, the player worked perfect for me right out of the box.",1,"train_pos"
"all-in-all, this is another excellent creative product.",1,"train_pos"
"if you have the money and need 40 gb, this is the player for you.",1,"train_pos"
"it's small, light and nice looking and the display is decent as well.",1,"train_pos"
"i would recommend this product to anyone.",1,"train_pos"
"it doesn't get any better than this.",1,"train_pos"
"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one, and now that i have it i couldn't be happier and i'm convinced it's the best one out there.",1,"train_pos"
"many people have written about the software being its one downfall, personally i haven't had a single problem with the software, i'm running windows me.",1,"train_pos"
"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy, and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player, so it won't take up space on your pc hard drive.",1,"train_pos"
"the software runs smooth, it's nice to look at, it's very organized, easy to follow and makes things very simple.",1,"train_pos"
"the controls on the player are very simple, no need for a manual.",1,"train_pos"
"the player is fast and sounds great, it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music, or making it sound like you're hearing the music in a huge auditorium.",1,"train_pos"
"the battery lasts very long when playing music, but writing files to the player drains the battery fast, so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files.",1,"train_pos"
"playlists can be made on the fly, without aid of a computer, and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists.",1,"train_pos"
"the software couldn't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream, i couldn't give this anything but a 5, i wish there was a 6.",1,"train_pos"
"i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3.",1,"train_pos"
"i have my mp3's stored on my workstation.",1,"train_pos"

") 3a.",1,"train_pos"
"sure it's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around, but it will be easier to manage and i'll save around 250 bucks.",1,"train_pos"
"""  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad.",1,"train_pos"
"it is an extremely cool gizmo.",1,"train_pos"
"great product.",1,"train_pos"
"well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players.",1,"train_pos"
"so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one.",1,"train_pos"
"well i decided to get this one.",1,"train_pos"
"well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket.",1,"train_pos"
"well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player (at that size and the price).",1,"train_pos"
"enjoy.",1,"train_pos"
"in a word... amazing i got this for christmas.",1,"train_pos"
"i was going to get a 10gb ipod, but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com (battery lasts 18 months;  it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99...  what a big improvement... lol) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers, i realized this is a much better buy.",1,"train_pos"
"not only is it more affordable, but its a better player for windows, which is what i have.",1,"train_pos"
"so far i've only had it since christmas, so i cant tell you much about the battery life.",1,"train_pos"
"it hasnt gone below the second notch (i charge mine whenever i'm at home and not using it), so the battery life seems fine (so far).",1,"train_pos"
"once you hook the thing up to the computer (via the usb cable), the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it's there &amp; installs the drivers.",1,"train_pos"
"from there, you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player (with the help of the media sniffer... read the manual).",1,"train_pos"
"if you're copying cds with windows media, its really simple to give your songs id3 tags, so thats what i do.",1,"train_pos"
"oh... and file transfers are fast &amp; easy.",1,"train_pos"
"the player: it's silver.",1,"train_pos"
"a little weighty (9 ounces... no biggie), but otherwise fine.",1,"train_pos"
"it's easy.",1,"train_pos"
"the buttons are easy to use, and its easy to navigate.",1,"train_pos"
"the big backlight makes things easy to see, and the writing is big enough for people to see.",1,"train_pos"
"my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature.",1,"train_pos"
"you can customize bass, etc.",1,"train_pos"
"like usual, but also you can customize the sound of the player (like how it would sound in a concert hall, jazz club, etc).",1,"train_pos"
"its really cool.",1,"train_pos"
"sound quality is amazing.",1,"train_pos"
"i was expecting worse, but its really good (especially if your files have good sound quality).",1,"train_pos"
"you can also slow a song down &amp; speed it up, which is cool too.",1,"train_pos"
"buy new ones asap.",1,"train_pos"
"so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button &amp; you're golden.",1,"train_pos"
"also, you can store data on it, which is a plus.",1,"train_pos"
"for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod, don't bother, this is a much better buy.",1,"train_pos"
"hope i helped!",1,"train_pos"
"i'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder...  what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox...  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible (which by hardware standards... they were)...  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software, the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo...  now we come to the zen xtra...  first i'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good...  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad (but still rather larger than i had expected)...  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent product with a few minor problems.",1,"train_pos"
"i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software, it doesn't care if you load cds onto the hard drive.",1,"train_pos"
"over time, i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer, and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive.",1,"train_pos"
"many people recommended the ipod, and i borrowed one from a friend.",1,"train_pos"
"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now, and i am very happy with it.",1,"train_pos"
"it's only slightly heavier than the ipod, and has a longer battery life.",1,"train_pos"
"the storage capacity is great for me --  i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free.",1,"train_pos"
"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod, but i have gotten use to them, and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price.",1,"train_pos"
"if the music had been on my home computer, the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly.",1,"train_pos"
"i have an older computer, running windows 98 se, and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker.",1,"train_pos"
"when you load a disc, you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks.",1,"train_pos"
"the cd will be classified into a number of genres, and in multidisk sets, you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance.",1,"train_pos"
"you can change any of these, but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it.",1,"train_pos"
"you don't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad, where cds are listed separately.",1,"train_pos"
"the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product.",1,"train_pos"
"apple's ipod is dominant now, but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly.",1,"train_pos"
"even better, ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap.",1,"train_pos"
"zen versus ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen (a 20gb model).",1,"train_pos"
"while the ipod's form factor is much nicer, here's where the zen is better.",1,"train_pos"
"software:  a lot of people complain about the creative software, but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes.",1,"train_pos"
"first, the zen lets you sync to more than one computer.",1,"train_pos"
"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources, you can't do this on the ipod (except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player).",1,"train_pos"
"second, the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer.",1,"train_pos"
"the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player.",1,"train_pos"
"third, creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer.",1,"train_pos"
"itunes does what apple is famous for, makes software that works for the less computer saavy.",1,"train_pos"
"for those of us that like to tinker, i think creative offers some advantages.",1,"train_pos"
"zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player.",1,"train_pos"
"it also lets you remove songs from the play order.",1,"train_pos"
"if you bring up an album, but absolutely hate some of the tracks, the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order.",1,"train_pos"
"again, the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch, player controls are less functional.",1,"train_pos"
"i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines.",1,"train_pos"
"win software can be a little cranky, but much more easier to customize to your needs.",1,"train_pos"
"with apple, you get a good product, but you get it the way apple wants you to have it.",1,"train_pos"
"its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent alternative.",1,"train_pos"
"i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent.",1,"train_pos"
"i got this player for christmas &amp; this was my first time using an mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far.",1,"train_pos"
"the software is quick &amp; easy to use &amp; i found the entire process very easily mastered.",1,"train_pos"
"the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car &amp; is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road!",1,"train_pos"
"overall it is a great unit &amp; hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it.",1,"train_pos"
"i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around.",1,"train_pos"
"the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact.",1,"train_pos"
"that's why you have these things that can be keychain size.",1,"train_pos"
"tiny!",1,"train_pos"
"mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory.",1,"train_pos"
"i am averaging 4.5 mb per song, to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory.",1,"train_pos"
"(1 gb = 1,000 mb)  hard drives (this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory).",1,"train_pos"
"that said, they are pretty sturdy machines and i wouldn't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory.",1,"train_pos"
"a 256 mb player (roughly 60 songs for me) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb (30,000 mb) player (roughly 6,650 songs) sells for only slightly more.",1,"train_pos"
"that's the first thing to understand.",1,"train_pos"
"so consider what you're going to use the device for.",1,"train_pos"
"if you're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm, i'd recommend flash memory.",1,"train_pos"
"if you want to listen to tunes while you travel, i'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books.",1,"train_pos"
"review of zen xtra - 40 gb  the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity.",1,"train_pos"
"this didn't bother me too much because it's still a decent size.",1,"train_pos"
"it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly.",1,"train_pos"
"the front cover (which you remove to take out the battery) feels flimsy but when snapped on, the device still feels pretty solid.",1,"train_pos"
"it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot.",1,"train_pos"
"the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist, track name and album name.",1,"train_pos"
"extremely convenient.",1,"train_pos"
"then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer.",1,"train_pos"
"you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player.",1,"train_pos"
"the pros and cons of it:  great price.",1,"train_pos"
"i thought the software was decent enough - it wasn't complicated to learn at all.",1,"train_pos"
"it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here.",1,"train_pos"
"i'm really happy with this purchase.",1,"train_pos"
"after i reviewed the manual (a pdf file included on the cd), i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it wouldn't cause problems and, in fact, it hasn't.",1,"train_pos"
"if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money, i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it.",1,"train_pos"
"i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size.",1,"train_pos"
"what a beast.",1,"train_pos"
"it is a beast.",1,"train_pos"
"if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox.",1,"train_pos"
"now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things: the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect, fast as hell in music transfer, controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button, great sound and ive heard many mp3 players, a ton of different equilizer type deals on here.",1,"train_pos"
"but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything.",1,"train_pos"
"ive seen em all, the archos, dell, ipods, everything... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion.",1,"train_pos"
"granted this is cheaper than an ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"cheaper in every way.",1,"train_pos"
"like the ipod (which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device).",1,"train_pos"
"before anyone says hey you haven't used the product, i have, my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product.",1,"train_pos"
"pros:  * price and capacity  * slick-looking design and improved interface  * removable battery  cons:  * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window.",1,"train_pos"
"excellent way to carry your music collection!",1,"train_pos"
"after investigating a multitude of player options, i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas.",1,"train_pos"
"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod, i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box!",1,"train_pos"
"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd, good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me.",1,"train_pos"
"file transfers are fast, nearly a song per second via usb 2.0.  several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title.",1,"train_pos"
"this is possible!!",1,"train_pos"
"simply configure the mediasource software (or windows media player, or your ripper-du-jour) to create file names that include artist and (especially) album names in addition to track names.",1,"train_pos"
"using this method, i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected, and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums.",1,"train_pos"
"even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc, you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player.",1,"train_pos"
"how does it sound?",1,"train_pos"
"to my ears, a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd, and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player.",1,"train_pos"
"no complaints there.",1,"train_pos"
"the eax features are pretty cool, as well, as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that, for example, compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train.",1,"train_pos"
"navigation could be better, but there isn't really anything the zen xtra can't do once you've gotten comfortable with it.",1,"train_pos"
"at the end of the day, what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go, and the zen xtra's combination of price, capacity and features easily meets those criteria.",1,"train_pos"
"cd collection in your pocket.",1,"train_pos"
"i got this for christmas, and it is a great gift.",1,"train_pos"
"i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks, and the ease of use is wonderful.",1,"train_pos"
"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs, my entire collection of cd's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun.",1,"train_pos"
"plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad.",1,"train_pos"
"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system, and the traveling case it comes with.",1,"train_pos"
"this is a powerful piece of equipment.",1,"train_pos"
"it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything.",1,"train_pos"
"ripping the songs, even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick, and the quality is very good.",1,"train_pos"
"considering the price and specs, this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"before jumping on the ipod train, take a look at this marvel.",1,"train_pos"
"but you might find my review useful, nonetheless.",1,"train_pos"
"it's really a shame, because otherwise, creative mp3 players are very good, and have the best sound quality of any players on the market.",1,"train_pos"
"the best ipod alternative.",1,"train_pos"
"i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player.",1,"train_pos"
"despite all the hype about ipods, i knew i wanted something different, because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer, and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online.",1,"train_pos"
"after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative, and i have not been disappointed.",1,"train_pos"
"i purchased it at a retail store, and got an extended warranty.",1,"train_pos"
"first, the battery is replacable by the user, because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod.",1,"train_pos"
"it was easy enough to remove the front plate, and there was only one way the battery could be inserted.",1,"train_pos"
"creative also sells batteries via its website, so there's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery.",1,"train_pos"
"the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra couldn't be easier to use.",1,"train_pos"
"point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest.",1,"train_pos"
"you can create playlists, drag &amp; drop songs and playlists to your player, and rip directly from cd to your player.",1,"train_pos"
"and with usb 2.0, transferring music to your player is incredibly easy.",1,"train_pos"
"you can also delete songs from the player itself, and create playlists - on the fly - on your player.",1,"train_pos"
"the sound is great, and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise.",1,"train_pos"
"i thought i'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it, but the included earbuds work quite well.",1,"train_pos"
"they could be more comfortable, but no complaints in the sound department.",1,"train_pos"
"i've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too.",1,"train_pos"
"there are plenty other features that i haven't checked out, but i'm sure i soon will.",1,"train_pos"
"it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it.",1,"train_pos"
"so now i keep it in my pocket.",1,"train_pos"
"important zen information.",1,"train_pos"
"zen good points:  1. i achieved my basic objective; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more.",1,"train_pos"
"the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i don't even notice the click.",1,"train_pos"
"btw, if you * are * ripping your cds, mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct &amp; uncluttered ] tag information.",1,"test_pos"
"when i turned eax off the static disappeared.",1,"test_pos"
"when i turned eax back on the static was also not present.",1,"test_pos"
"do not underestimate this in your purchase decision.",1,"test_pos"
"you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons, first the pause button, then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button.",1,"test_pos"
"i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine.",1,"test_pos"
"third party software to the rescue  after much frustration (above) i found the notmad explorer; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer &amp; organization problems.",1,"test_pos"
"i am not associated with the company, i am not providing a url, but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily.",1,"test_pos"
"this provides drag &amp; drop transfers of music between the computer &amp; zen; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen (.",1,"test_pos"
"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp, but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists); it doesn't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray!",1,"test_pos"
"given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software.",1,"test_pos"
"the only creative software i am using is the device driver (s).",1,"test_pos"
"how did i get by without this?",1,"test_pos"
"now that i own it, however, i can't imagine being without it!",1,"test_pos"
"i have stored around 60 cd's (at 160kbps) on this and have barely touched the available memory.",1,"test_pos"
"the sound quality is fantastic (cd quality) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd's or tapes!",1,"test_pos"
"it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device.",1,"test_pos"
"i didn't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive.",1,"test_pos"
"i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes.",1,"test_pos"
"the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated.",1,"test_pos"
"one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software.",1,"test_pos"
"whereas some folks have the "" ipod "", i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" (not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "").",1,"test_pos"
"i can't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"great memory, quality?",1,"test_pos"
"in a quick summation, here is what i found.",1,"test_pos"
"+ the memory (40 gb) is staggering.",1,"test_pos"
"it may have taken several years to fill this up.",1,"test_pos"
"+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit  + screen was good, easy to read  + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great.",1,"test_pos"
"great product great price.",1,"test_pos"
"i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra... and i was not disappointed.",1,"test_pos"
"the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality.",1,"test_pos"
"navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer (and vice versa) was easy too.",1,"test_pos"
"many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it's easy to use and effective.",1,"test_pos"
"i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision.",1,"test_pos"
"i cannot recommend it enough!",1,"test_pos"
"the price / performance looked just right.",1,"test_pos"
"when i bought it late last year, there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal, but it sounded like a fair tradeoff.",1,"test_pos"
"now let's talk about the software.",1,"test_pos"
"i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement.",1,"test_pos"
"but that's a moot point now.",1,"test_pos"
"no way, now i have an ipod and i'm a very happy man.",1,"test_pos"
"also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac.",1,"test_pos"
"great value &amp; great sound; carry your entire collection!",1,"test_pos"
"pros:  1) great sound (> 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod's "" unspecified "" ratio) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers.",1,"test_pos"
"with my sennheiser 497 headphones, the volume is loud enough at 12 (max is 20).",1,"test_pos"
"the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers.",1,"test_pos"
"2) the player user interface (ui) is intuitive to use, and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection.",1,"test_pos"
"3) the nomad explorer (winxp style interface) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player.",1,"test_pos"
"the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad.",1,"test_pos"
"4) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers (1 song / sec!).",1,"test_pos"
"5) the cheap, user-replaceable battery ($ 50 from creative) is a great advantage over the ipod's battery which costs $ 100 to replace.",1,"test_pos"
"6) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod's.",1,"test_pos"
"7) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate.",1,"test_pos"
"i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk (by accident) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather (by design) and it has continued to work fine.",1,"test_pos"
"8) creative mediasource, although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer, is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service (gracenotes).",1,"test_pos"
"a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album, artist, song title, etc.",1,"test_pos"
"i don't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags.",1,"test_pos"
"b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc (2.4 ghz with 1gb ram) with 52x drive.",1,"test_pos"
"c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer.",1,"test_pos"
"9) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time.",1,"test_pos"
"i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning.",1,"test_pos"
"10) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album, shuffle, etc., is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter.",1,"test_pos"
"11) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player  12) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device (5717 songs, 491 albums and counting)!",1,"test_pos"
"2) music organization is based on id3 (by genre, artist, album, etc.",1,"test_pos"
"this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music.",1,"test_pos"
"both creative and third-party powered speakers work great, as do third-party wireless transmitters.",1,"test_pos"
"a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary.",1,"test_pos"
"7) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch.",1,"test_pos"
"recommendations:  1) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive.",1,"test_pos"
"2) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one.",1,"test_pos"
"3) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year.",1,"test_pos"
"4) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player's usability (the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio, home receiver, etc.)",1,"test_pos"
"resources: http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net  pros summary:  great sound; good interface; replaceable, powerful battery; good software; wake-up, sleep timers; multiple play modes  cons summary:  not plug &amp; play; relies on id3; no fm or recording  bottom-line:  can't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go.",1,"test_pos"

"i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas.",1,"test_pos"
"those who don't like it are ipod lovers and are in denial.",1,"test_pos"
"this thing does its job.",1,"test_pos"
"i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.",1,"test_pos"
"replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod's $ 150.  cons:  the only thing i don't like about this is the cover does suck.",1,"test_pos"
"the best jukebox mp3 player, hands-down.",1,"test_pos"
"i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99.  the combination of the price, storage size, and player features makes this player the best on the market.",1,"test_pos"
"the battery stays charged for a long time, and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter.",1,"test_pos"
"connect the player to your computer (via usb), open up mediasource, and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra!",1,"test_pos"
"get those mp3s off your hard drive, save space, and enjoy your massive music library.",1,"test_pos"
"awesome feature.",1,"test_pos"
"usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast.",1,"test_pos"
"not a big hassle as many would have you think.",1,"test_pos"
"hard disk mp3 players.",1,"test_pos"
"if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod, creative zen, rio karma and iriver ihp - you'll notice that each has their pros and cons; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later.",1,"test_pos"
"ipod clearly has the most buzz.",1,"test_pos"
"great design and looks cool.",1,"test_pos"
"everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery, yet this is the price of sturdy construction.",1,"test_pos"
"ipod can be used as an external disk, and apparently stores files without problem.",1,"test_pos"
"reviews for sound quality are generally (but not universally) positive.",1,"test_pos"
"the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced.",1,"test_pos"
"reviews for sound quality are generally (but not universally) positive.",1,"test_pos"
"veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that's what you want.",1,"test_pos"
"karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device, which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity.",1,"test_pos"
"usability (button usage, feature selection, menu structure, display size and quality) also has good feedback.",1,"test_pos"
"those that have it like it.",1,"test_pos"
"otherwise feedback seems to be good.",1,"test_pos"
"good for a little while, but... sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price.",1,"test_pos"
"wow.",1,"test_pos"
"don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week.",1,"test_pos"
"if you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"if you really need to save, buy this thing on amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund.",1,"test_pos"
"i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player, and i'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out.",1,"test_pos"
"i bought the player this week and i like it by far.",1,"test_pos"
"this is my fourth mp3 player (creative nomad jukebox2 and 3, rio chie, and this one), and my third player from creative.",1,"test_pos"
"pro: 1.  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years.",1,"test_pos"
"2.  value: comparing data storage with price.",1,"test_pos"
"3.  size and style:  the appearance is okayed (at least not ugly).",1,"test_pos"
"the size is small (just a little bit bigger than an i-pod.)",1,"test_pos"
"however, the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems.",1,"test_pos"
"ps: (mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping, tagging, music database managing, music file transfering, and more)  now i use ms mediaplayer, musicmatch (free downladed), and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource.",1,"test_pos"
"in short, this player is good at size, value, hardware design but really bad at its software",1,"test_pos"
"a great player, excellent sound quality, hovewer, has flaws.",1,"test_pos"
"now as others said, so far this player is an awesome player, there are flaws.",1,"test_pos"
"cons:  1.  the display is awesome, you can see everything you want and read it clearly  2.  huge storage space, i loaded my entire collection of music, which isnt that much, 400 songs, and still have 26 gb, out of the 28 provided to you.",1,"test_pos"
"and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.",1,"test_pos"
"3.  the sound is awesome, but if u put it too loud, depends on yoursound quality, the sound might crack.",1,"test_pos"
"4.  with eax on, you can modify your sound, with 4 different presets, which is pretty good, you can get different variations with it.",1,"test_pos"
"5.  if you use software correctly, put in all the id3 tags, you will get an awesome database collection, from which you can easily access your songs.",1,"test_pos"
"you can also search for your song, which is good.",1,"test_pos"
"6.  i dont know what other people are saying, but the software is awesome.",1,"test_pos"
"you can easily access ur files, and easily fill in the id3 tags, which can take a while with a big collection of music, but if your not lazy, you will do it without a problem.",1,"test_pos"
"and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3, so its not a problem.",1,"test_pos"
"7.  battery recharge, is an awesome thing, because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours.",1,"test_pos"
"8.  when you turn on your player, the player turns on really fast, and the music continues to play, as you left it when you were turning it off.",1,"test_pos"
"9.  you can manage your profile, change the contrast of backlight, make different type of display, either list or tabbed.",1,"test_pos"
"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface, you can see the interface as modern or classical.",1,"test_pos"
"there is an alarm, i still havent used it yet, but it should be good.",1,"test_pos"
"there is a clock, and date, which can get helpful.",1,"test_pos"
"10.  the player has firmware, which will remove the glitches, if there are any.",1,"test_pos"
"11.  the music plays awesome, never skips, even if u run for a bit, so you can listen to music without interruption.",1,"test_pos"
"easy to use, massive storage space, sounds great.",1,"test_pos"
"and also, it's priced very affordably.",1,"test_pos"
"with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player (everything music file i have is on there) with room for about 2,500 more.",1,"test_pos"
"a similarily priced 15gb ipod wouldn't have been nearly enough room.",1,"test_pos"
"having my entire music collection is great when travelling (both on plane and car trips) and i don't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it's all there.",1,"test_pos"
"having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage.",1,"test_pos"
"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted.",1,"test_pos"
"the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones.",1,"test_pos"
"on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good.",1,"test_pos"
"sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference.",1,"test_pos"
"accessing files by artist and album (i mostly look things up by artist) is easy and intuitive.",1,"test_pos"
"possibly the biggest advantage this player has (if price wasn't enough) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery.",1,"test_pos"
"since batteries do run out on everything, this will also be a big money-saver since ipods, irivers, rca, dell, all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician (apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement).",1,"test_pos"
"try before you buy if at all possible: although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod, the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface.",1,"test_pos"
"i like the nomad's color better, but it's not terribly flashy.",1,"test_pos"
"my advice to mp3 buyers: consider how much storage space you will need, then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them.",1,"test_pos"
"good for the price.",1,"test_pos"
"i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it.",1,"test_pos"
"the pros:  price!",1,"test_pos"
"almost half what an ipod would cost you!",1,"test_pos"
"i don't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me.",1,"test_pos"
"sound quality is wonderful, i really like the smart volume sound normalization.",1,"test_pos"
"i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough.",1,"test_pos"
"i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!",1,"test_pos"
"redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more!",1,"test_pos"
"great player.",1,"test_pos"
"have had the player since xmass and love it!",1,"test_pos"
"pros:  great sound, very long battery life (i routinely play it for 12 + hours), very fast recharges rate, removable battery, storage size, nice screen, firmware updates, and great price.",1,"test_pos"
"i just bought notmad manager ($ 25) and file transfers are easy drag and drop, songs stored by id3 tags not by folders, needs to have software on computer to transfer files, no window on case (nice case otherwise.",1,"test_pos"
"i don't see what everyone's problem is - i love this player.",1,"test_pos"
"this is an excellent player, especially for the price, with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"for a price that's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster, and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some.",1,"test_pos"
"here are the pros and cons (few there are) in detail:  look / design:  the system is terrific in size and design, imo looking better than the ipods.",1,"test_pos"
"it's bigger, but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods.",1,"test_pos"
"it's very solidly built, and has a nice dense feel to it.",1,"test_pos"
"i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least.",1,"test_pos"
"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod's as well, in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you're there.",1,"test_pos"
"the screen's large and easily read.",1,"test_pos"
"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face, that sometimes comes off a bit easily, but besides that it's perfect.",1,"test_pos"
"sound: exceptional, though i can't really compare it to the ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"from what i've heard it's at least equal.",1,"test_pos"
"like others have mentioned, you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they're on lower bit levels.",1,"test_pos"
"there's no so-called background hiss that i've noticed, at least so far.",1,"test_pos"
"interface - practically seamless.",1,"test_pos"
"songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags, which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver.",1,"test_pos"
"yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order (with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out) it actually turns out to be really handy.",1,"test_pos"
"it's a dedicated music playing device, anyway, so this serves it better.",1,"test_pos"
"you can find any song quicky by an artist, album, or genre search.",1,"test_pos"
"playlists can be generated on the fly (which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus) or by using the software, and there are a bevy of eq options.",1,"test_pos"
"software:  as i mentioned before, the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said, though notmad may still work better.",1,"test_pos"
"it's easy to transfer, preview, and organize files.",1,"test_pos"
"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point, as well.",1,"test_pos"
"it was no problem for me to use their software.",1,"test_pos"
"some may complain that there's no drag-and-drop capability, but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player, not a computer accessory or hard drive.",1,"test_pos"
"the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience.",1,"test_pos"
"overall, i'm giving this 5 stars as i've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over, but as i've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack, hissing, or scroll wheel problems show up with me too.",1,"test_pos"
"so far, however, i'm a very happy customer.",1,"test_pos"
"please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"and expected it to be flawless.",1,"test_pos"
"honestly, i love this player.",1,"test_pos"
"once again, the sound is awesome, the batterly life is only 6-8 hours, and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life.",1,"test_pos"
"ok so i donno about what other people said, how the player breaks and stuff, and the headfone jack, fortunately that did not happen to me.",1,"test_pos"
"this is all i have to say.",1,"test_pos"
"those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it.",1,"test_pos"
"the price is way below an ipod of the same size.",1,"test_pos"
"the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod.",1,"test_pos"
"the sound quality is very good.",1,"test_pos"
"because of the large capacity of the nomad, owners can load hundreds of cds on to it.",1,"test_pos"
"for most people, they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection.",1,"test_pos"
"having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific.",1,"test_pos"
"they fall in love with the product.",1,"test_pos"
"this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it, and get used to having it.",1,"test_pos"
"maybe more competitors will bring out similar products.",1,"test_pos"
"i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month.",1,"test_pos"
"it worked good for a while.",1,"test_pos"

"awkward remote; flimsy build quality.",-1,"train_neg"

"the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use.",-1,"train_neg"
"in addition, it only seems to work if you're about five feet away from the player, although that may have been just the batteries that came with it.",-1,"train_neg"

"a very embarassing gift.",-1,"train_neg"

"it played only one out of three dvd's without problems, the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches.",-1,"train_neg"
"both of the problem dvd's would repeatedly freeze during playback, while the counter on the player kept going.",-1,"train_neg"
"one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu.",-1,"train_neg"
"these problems were consistent, and also not present on another dvd player.",-1,"train_neg"
"the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed.",-1,"train_neg"
"all in all, trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift.",-1,"train_neg"

"you get what you pay for.",-1,"train_neg"
"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open (my prev.",-1,"train_neg"

"however, it has failed to deliver on quality.",-1,"train_neg"
"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs, it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies.",-1,"train_neg"
"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside.",-1,"train_neg"
"after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common.",-1,"train_neg"
"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand, but with my experience and reading the other reviews, i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product.",-1,"train_neg"
"i am returning mine for a replacement, but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund, but never buy another apex product in the future.",-1,"train_neg"

"the ad2600 had false silver plate instead of play display.",-1,"train_neg"
"the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display.",-1,"train_neg"
"bait and switch.",-1,"train_neg"
"picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured, yet false silver plate.",-1,"train_neg"
"clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined.",-1,"train_neg"
"no go on most formats.",-1,"train_neg"
"however, it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips.",-1,"train_neg"
"i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats, but others say they can.",-1,"train_neg"
"can't say whether i rec'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw's or vcd's for me.",-1,"train_neg"
"i don't have a dvd + r to try  so.",-1,"train_neg"
"well, not with this one.",-1,"train_neg"
"only problem, if you think it's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims, don't hold your breath.",-1,"train_neg"
"however, i don't know the dvd's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing.",-1,"train_neg"
"ensure you get a larger flash, 128 or 256, some are selling with the larger flash, 32mb will do in a pinch but you'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras.",-1,"train_neg"
"some things that i didn't like (but hey.",-1,"train_neg"
"nothing is perfect).",-1,"train_neg"
"* main dial is not backlit.",-1,"train_neg"
"* lens visible in optical viewfinder.",-1,"train_neg"
"flaws?",-1,"train_neg"
"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle, but since i use the lcd most of the time, this is not really much of a bother to me.",-1,"train_neg"
"still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial.",-1,"train_neg"
"its very small and hard to turn so you can't get an accurate adjustment (for those of you who don't know what a diopter adjustment is, it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight.)",-1,"train_neg"
"negatives  1) quite bulky (it's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr) and uses a heavy battery, although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic (unlike canon's elph line)  2) not very ergonomical - you'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens)  4) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying.",-1,"train_neg"
"the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap (it is not very snug and can come off too easily) and the lens itself (it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd).",-1,"train_neg"
"don't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype.",-1,"train_neg"
"unless you want to print murals, you don't need it.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would recommend a larger compact-flash card, at least 128 mb.",-1,"train_neg"
"at the same time, i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons.",-1,"train_neg"
"i tried out some other brands in the stores, and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company; plus what you see in the lcd (no optical finder) isn't what you get - not even for color; the output was less than i expected.",-1,"train_neg"
"warning - i did read the manual!",-1,"train_neg"
"it doesn't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can't access them quickly when you need them!",-1,"train_neg"
"i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow!",-1,"train_neg"
"if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera, this is probably not what you are looking for.",-1,"train_neg"
"the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens.",-1,"train_neg"
"noise level this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500.",-1,"train_neg"
"i wish canon would work out some way for that issue.",-1,"train_neg"
"the zooming lever is shaky, i hope it does not operate mechanically, otherwise you'll feel uneasy.",-1,"train_neg"
"ok for a digital camera maybe it is my lack of experience, but i found shots with this camera very disappointing.",-1,"train_neg"
"it was (i sold it after a few months) too expensive for the shots that i got.",-1,"train_neg"
"sure it had all the features, but when i tried to shoot a girl's basketball game it just wan't up to the task.",-1,"train_neg"
"i don't think i was asking too much.",-1,"train_neg"
"i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust.",-1,"train_neg"
"sure, i adjusted the film speed to 400.  the grain was terrible.",-1,"train_neg"
"well flash photos are never great, and there was still a lot of noise.",-1,"train_neg"
"getting the printer to help output them was another tale.",-1,"train_neg"
"for simple point and shoot photography, consider a cheaper digital.",-1,"train_neg"
"you don't need the extra resolution or the cost.",-1,"train_neg"
"then again a one time use camera may do just as well.",-1,"train_neg"
"me, i am going with a leica minilux (the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen).",-1,"train_neg"
"i figure that is at least three years off, and i am getting impatient.",-1,"train_neg"
"hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations.",-1,"train_neg"
"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash.",-1,"train_neg"
"as of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr.",-1,"train_neg"
"now what about the flash problem?",-1,"train_neg"
"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr, the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots.",-1,"train_neg"
"i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera, but i can use my metz, with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4.",-1,"train_neg"
"in order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself.",-1,"train_neg"
"then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel, because they are all ignored.",-1,"train_neg"
"this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away.",-1,"train_neg"
"unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem cant easily be solved.",-1,"train_neg"
"the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz (with the attendant shadows unfortunately).",-1,"train_neg"
"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!",-1,"train_neg"
"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"i didnt wait to experiment.",-1,"train_neg"
"battery life, the drawback to most digital cameras, to quote k. reeves.",-1,"train_neg"
"if you don't believe me on that, check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there.",-1,"train_neg"
"about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder.",-1,"train_neg"
"but who cares?",-1,"train_neg"
"i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon (both slrs).",-1,"train_neg"
"i've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens, but the pictures were too digital.",-1,"train_neg"
"i don't need to go into exhustive review of this camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"but there are two things i don't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews.",-1,"train_neg"
"1) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"i'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap, i may damage the lens.",-1,"train_neg"
"very cheaply made.",-1,"train_neg"
"2) the body construction - buttons, casing, etc, are too plastic.",-1,"train_neg"
"there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world, losing a few that i really regretted.",-1,"train_neg"
"i did have ability to charge it every night, so don't know how long it would have actually gone before dying.",-1,"train_neg"
"i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures.",-1,"train_neg"
"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder, but does not detract from the image at all.",-1,"train_neg"
"these things may get a lot better in the future, but from what i've seen in the last few years, the technology for digital cameras isn't advancing at the pace of pc's, phones and hard drives.",-1,"train_neg"
"boxy?",-1,"train_neg"
"i was perfectly happy with my g2, so why did i trade up to the g3?",-1,"train_neg"
"the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely.",-1,"train_neg"
"it is not perfect though.",-1,"train_neg"
"here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far:  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder.",-1,"train_neg"
"(i knew this before hand, and it is not that bad) there is no tiff format.",-1,"train_neg"
"to save a picture as raw, you have to have the display on, this seems like a waste of battery power.",-1,"train_neg"
"it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter?",-1,"train_neg"
"(again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are.)",-1,"train_neg"
"for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop.",-1,"train_neg"
"a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use.",-1,"train_neg"
"poor quality pics, short battery life, slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film.",-1,"train_neg"
"you can always spend more money to get a better one.",-1,"train_neg"
"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card, and for most purposes, it is not enough.",-1,"train_neg"
"for '' cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and doesn't have any wow factor.",-1,"train_neg"
"negative points:  the included memory card is too small.",-1,"train_neg"
"it is made of plastic.",-1,"train_neg"
"for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped, picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience.",-1,"train_neg"
"this is by no means unique to this model, i'm sure.",-1,"train_neg"
"the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot.",-1,"train_neg"
"this is not a handbag camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"while light, it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets.",-1,"train_neg"
"the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile.",-1,"train_neg"
"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras, you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost.",-1,"train_neg"
"the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to.",-1,"train_neg"
"if you can afford this camera, you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble.",-1,"train_neg"
"my story is based on personal usage.",-1,"train_neg"
"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion (i don't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i'm going to get) in the viewfinder when you don't zoom (when you zoom the lens distortion goes away), canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture.",-1,"train_neg"
"as with taking digital pictures, i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand.",-1,"train_neg"
"i've haven't heard about a diagnos or fix for this.",-1,"train_neg"
"the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions (camera and cf) bending (can lead to cf erros) or losing it.",-1,"train_neg"
"my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens (the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes) and i'm getting the those (52 mm adapter and uv lens filter) at lensmateonline.com.",-1,"train_neg"
"beware you see, i can't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with (j and r camera.)",-1,"train_neg"
"to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product.",-1,"train_neg"
"although you may think you're dealing with amazon, you're dealing with some second rate store that you've never heard of.",-1,"train_neg"
"after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping, 5 business days later, they still hadn't shipped the product.",-1,"train_neg"
"i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "".",-1,"train_neg"
"one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit, he said, "" actually we don't ship on saturdays "".",-1,"train_neg"
"so why lie about it?",-1,"train_neg"
"so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet.",-1,"train_neg"
"although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan, they still didn't ship it.",-1,"train_neg"
"they said it is in stock, but they are "" too busy "".",-1,"train_neg"
"they weren't busy enough to charge the credit card, though!",-1,"train_neg"
"although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything, the replies i got were inept as if they hadn't taken time to read the complaint.",-1,"train_neg"
"i cancelled the order.",-1,"train_neg"
"hope to get my refund in a timely manner.",-1,"train_neg"
"thanks for nothing, amazon!",-1,"train_neg"
"major design flaw this camera has a major design flaw.",-1,"train_neg"
"when you look through the viewfinder (not the lcd) the bottom left corner of the picture (about 15%) is blocked by the lens.",-1,"train_neg"
"i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder, they finally admitted, it was a design flaw in the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"however for me, i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much.",-1,"train_neg"
"i'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected.",-1,"train_neg"
"i've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330, and the g3 seems to do only slightly better.",-1,"train_neg"
"(i'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level.)",-1,"train_neg"
"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330.",-1,"train_neg"
"i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images:  i can imagine that they'd fill up my ibook's internal memory pretty quickly.",-1,"train_neg"
"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking, it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap, and it is a bit slow between shots.",-1,"train_neg"
"the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card, which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution, i intend to buy a bigger card soon.",-1,"train_neg"
"not too excited i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400.",-1,"train_neg"
"it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid.",-1,"train_neg"
"with nikon, although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras, i've had the following headaches;  1. pictures won't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable.",-1,"train_neg"
"i did everything i could, and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader.",-1,"train_neg"
"2. the speed is noticeably slower than canon, especially so with flashes on.",-1,"train_neg"
"3. with low battery, it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip.",-1,"train_neg"
"be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries.",-1,"train_neg"
"but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though,.",-1,"train_neg"
"this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can't be stopped.",-1,"train_neg"
"would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing.. if you want to have the date; time on the image, its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date; time from the images meta-data.",-1,"train_neg"
"so if you use your card reader; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date; time.",-1,"train_neg"
"in that too, there isn't a direct way to add date; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date; time.. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image.",-1,"train_neg"
"images taken indoor weren't so clear.",-1,"train_neg"
"you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit.",-1,"train_neg"
"lens cap is a really annoying.",-1,"train_neg"
"else with simpler viking cf cards, it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size: 1600.. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can't avoid that.",-1,"train_neg"
"bad service within a year, there are problems with my menu dial knob.",-1,"train_neg"
"it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes.",-1,"train_neg"
"i send my camera to nikon for servicing, took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem.",-1,"train_neg"
"worse of all, they claim that it's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty!",-1,"train_neg"
"they wouldn't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts?",-1,"train_neg"
"it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality, but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service.",-1,"train_neg"
"system error got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase.",-1,"train_neg"
"made the camera totally inoperable.",-1,"train_neg"
"also, the lens cap design is flawed.",-1,"train_neg"
"you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it.",-1,"train_neg"
"audio on video also lacking.",-1,"train_neg"

"2. i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i wasn't comfortable with that.",-1,"train_neg"
"a few things that might make it even better:  1. pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance.",-1,"train_neg"
"2. it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow.",-1,"train_neg"
"3. the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture.",-1,"train_neg"
"try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems.",-1,"train_neg"
"whichever camera you buy, add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card, usb card reader, camera bag and the warranty.",-1,"train_neg"
"the battery life is ok, but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on.",-1,"train_neg"
"however, indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy.",-1,"train_neg"
"focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time, pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange.",-1,"train_neg"
"pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry.",-1,"train_neg"
"the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button, which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models.",-1,"train_neg"
"however, as an average person with unsteady hands, i doubt it'll perform well in lower light settings.",-1,"train_neg"
"very large pics take 8mb each!",-1,"train_neg"
"the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too.",-1,"train_neg"
"i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions, but doesn't seem any of the buget cameras do.",-1,"train_neg"
"i took the camera and just gave it to someone.",-1,"train_neg"
"no instructions.",-1,"train_neg"
"one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low.",-1,"train_neg"
"i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus.",-1,"train_neg"
"it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade!",-1,"train_neg"
"the only drawbacks that i have noticed:  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long, especially if you use the flash a lot.",-1,"train_neg"
"so, it's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging.",-1,"train_neg"
"it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would say that this is not a major issue, but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things.",-1,"train_neg"
"for more, you sacrifice weight and size: more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length.",-1,"train_neg"
"it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom, but you sacrifice quality.",-1,"train_neg"
"i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason:  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries.",-1,"train_neg"
"in manual, you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic; this is not really a hinderance, you just have to be familiar with its menus and features.",-1,"train_neg"
"one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures, one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics, but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb, the math does not add up.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per.",-1,"train_neg"
"the only drawbacks i've encountered are: 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color, but i've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i've used even on a nikon slr.",-1,"train_neg"
"2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations.",-1,"train_neg"
"3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate, but not very robust.",-1,"train_neg"
"i'll still use my photosuite for editing.",-1,"train_neg"
"one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing.",-1,"train_neg"
"the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on, the camera won't fit in the small cases, and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find.",-1,"train_neg"
"i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots.",-1,"train_neg"
"now where did i put that manual?",-1,"train_neg"
"i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card.",-1,"train_neg"
"on average, indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm.",-1,"train_neg"
"i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion.",-1,"train_neg"
"buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short.",-1,"train_neg"
"don't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card.",-1,"train_neg"
"i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos.",-1,"train_neg"
"i can't connect it to my computer though, but that's a problem with windows me, not the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"i only have one complaint, and that is the 8mb card included.",-1,"train_neg"
"8mb for a camera like this is a joke.",-1,"train_neg"
"a card with more memory is a must.",-1,"train_neg"
"a minor quibble, since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards.",-1,"train_neg"
"here's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera:  1 no direct firewire to the camera.",-1,"train_neg"
"2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68, the optical viewfinder is partially obscured.",-1,"train_neg"
"3 battery has to be removed to recharge.",-1,"train_neg"
"4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery's out is not included, although one can be purchased separately.",-1,"train_neg"
"5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses.",-1,"train_neg"
"most of these "" annoyances "", though, are comparable to what you'll find on other cameras in this price range.",-1,"train_neg"
"after several years of torture in the hands of at&amp;t customer service i am delighted to drop them, and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&amp;t to t-mobile!",-1,"train_neg"

"i spent hours setting up the stations (accepts about 13-14, i believe), though the reception is unpredictable.",-1,"train_neg"
"also, you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious.",-1,"train_neg"
"the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine!",-1,"train_neg"
"the phone comes with okay ringtones, some decent backgrounds / screensavers, but the phone has very little memory (mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon, so you don't have too many options on what you can put on there).",-1,"train_neg"
"the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i'd have liked them to be.",-1,"train_neg"
"the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly (dangerous when you're driving at night), and there's no way to change this --  i checked with nokia.",-1,"train_neg"
"the buttons on the phone are small, even for my small fingertips, but you get used to them rather quickly.",-1,"train_neg"
"the menu options are uncreative, as you can't see a full screen of menu items to pick from; you have to scroll up and down to find what you're looking for (yes, this is minor, but not when you're trying to keep your eye on the road!).",-1,"train_neg"
"more downside to this phone?",-1,"train_neg"
"oh my goodness --  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet.",-1,"train_neg"
"forget talking on it in public -- you just can't hear the other person!",-1,"train_neg"
"i do like this phone overall (would give it a 3.5), but unforutnately, i am returning it.",-1,"train_neg"

"since i received the phone, i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "".",-1,"train_neg"
"i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks, when t-zones never worked.",-1,"train_neg"
"by what time standards -- martian?",-1,"train_neg"
"apparently, t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can't keep up with demands.",-1,"train_neg"
"also, they'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service (duh), so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out.",-1,"train_neg"
"but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they've answered all your questions, even if they didn't, to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you.",-1,"train_neg"
"i realize this is for quality assurance purposes, but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered (i.e.",-1,"train_neg"

"however, the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static, to the point where i'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line.",-1,"train_neg"
"and no t-zones.",-1,"train_neg"
"so what's the point?",-1,"train_neg"
"guess all that glitters is not gold.",-1,"train_neg"
"it was worth a shot -- too bad it didn't work out.",-1,"train_neg"

"it is a teeny phone, so it is hard to put a big mechanism in.",-1,"train_neg"
"i don't use the vibration, because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it.",-1,"train_neg"

"nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon.",-1,"train_neg"

"menu flaws?",-1,"train_neg"
"mine couldn't send text messages.",-1,"train_neg"
"when i got it home, i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply weren't there:  it defaulted to unchangeable email.",-1,"train_neg"

"poor visibility on the keys.",-1,"train_neg"
"you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them.",-1,"train_neg"
"only one complaint about the speakerphone, you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone, not while it is ringing.",-1,"train_neg"
"the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile.",-1,"train_neg"
"the phone has a few minor inconveniences, but only because it lacks those features, bluetooth and high spend internet, but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do.",-1,"train_neg"
"cons:  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings, there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring.",-1,"train_neg"
"the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out.",-1,"train_neg"

"the keys are close together, and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not too weird.",-1,"train_neg"
"the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing, as many phones use the "" # "" key instead.",-1,"train_neg"
"there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient.",-1,"train_neg"
"the menu options appear one at a time, taking up the whole screen, and one has to scroll down one by one, or have memorized where they are in the menu order, to select them by using the number keypad.",-1,"train_neg"
"thumbs down on that one.",-1,"train_neg"
"the vibrate setting is loud!",-1,"train_neg"
"so loud, really, that it doesn't work terribly well as a silent ringer option.",-1,"train_neg"
"but, then again, the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office, when i was already out on the street...  which was a good thing, because i realized i had forgotten my phone...  other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack.",-1,"train_neg"

"aight den bumpy?",-1,"train_neg"
"just make sure the keys are locked.",-1,"train_neg"

"i'm pay in auto-debit in my account.",-1,"train_neg"
"i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features, but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone.",-1,"train_neg"
"the downside though, may be a big one for you.",-1,"train_neg"
"i've gotten used to it (holding it in just the right realation to the ear, ducking into quieter places in bars) but when others borrow it they're shocked i can use it.",-1,"train_neg"

"although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing, this phone does not have voice dialing.",-1,"train_neg"
"the keypad is a decent size, but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press.",-1,"train_neg"
"in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control.",-1,"train_neg"
"it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone.",-1,"train_neg"
"one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia, so standard headphones will not work.",-1,"train_neg"
"one complaint... the screen is too easily scratched!",-1,"train_neg"
"but there are faceplates to replace it i guess...  almost there.",-1,"train_neg"
"i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089, but was waiting for the right phone to come along.",-1,"train_neg"
"what it lacks for me isn't available on one phone yet, namely gsm850 (also sometimes known as gsm800), bluetooth and edge.",-1,"train_neg"
"oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone, but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam.",-1,"train_neg"
"i went to an at &amp;#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads.",-1,"train_neg"

"bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better.",-1,"train_neg"
"one more thing, the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible.",-1,"train_neg"
"even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them.",-1,"train_neg"

"my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons.",-1,"train_neg"
"nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad, which imho is totally unnecessary.",-1,"train_neg"

"the gprs connection is sometimes slow, and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain, but the other t-zones applications are quite useful.",-1,"train_neg"
"one downside: as of this writing, t-mobile hasn't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610.  their website does not show it as a compatible phone, and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported.",-1,"train_neg"
"t-mobile ruins an otherwise good phone.",-1,"train_neg"

"yet they've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone, including italian, german, and dutch.",-1,"train_neg"
"the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile's services, because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network.",-1,"train_neg"

"after fiddling around with it for a while, i notice a few dissapointments:  transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0.  it would only transfer 30 or so songs, and then come up with an error.",-1,"train_neg"
"having 4000 or so mp3s, i never got more than 500 transfered.",-1,"train_neg"
"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter, but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling.",-1,"train_neg"

"first, the cons... a tad bulky... not the most asthetic looking player... and doesn't support a folder stucture.",-1,"train_neg"
"the cons aren't really a big deal to me... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files... no folder structure... and it's based on the title of the songs... many of my songs where seperated into folders (on the pc)... and a few had same titles... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i didn't have any that might be the same as another.",-1,"train_neg"
"and man... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title..  and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese, and not the track info)... all it saw were ""?",-1,"train_neg"

"needless to say, i wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing this product.",-1,"train_neg"

"the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd.",-1,"train_neg"
"the warranty is 90 days.",-1,"train_neg"
"this is ridiculous.",-1,"train_neg"
"to me this alludes to the manufacturer's confidence that the product will last for a year.",-1,"train_neg"
"buy the re-seller's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later, after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time (probably sooner than later).",-1,"train_neg"
"the scroll wheel, to be blunt, sucks.",-1,"train_neg"
"seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection.",-1,"train_neg"
"the interface used could be better designed.",-1,"train_neg"
"it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want.",-1,"train_neg"
"i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this, there would be hell to pay, not to mention the ridicule from my peers.",-1,"train_neg"
"and the case, how did this ever make it out of quality control.",-1,"train_neg"
"the screen is covered, so to make any new selections you have to open it.",-1,"train_neg"
"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls, especially the scroll wheel.",-1,"train_neg"
"there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet, so you have to live with it.",-1,"train_neg"
"despite the things that i have listed so far, i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work, to the gym, in the car, etc..  however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times.",-1,"train_neg"
"i have had it lock up after a transfer of music.",-1,"train_neg"
"the files are there, but i could not access the player without removing the battery, waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery.",-1,"train_neg"
"also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call.",-1,"train_neg"
"left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over.",-1,"train_neg"

"now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured, but since i received it as a gift i now have this one.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology.",-1,"train_neg"
"and we all know about the rush to market on new products.",-1,"train_neg"
"i have had this player for 2 weeks, i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit.",-1,"train_neg"
"while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so (from the purchase date) to obtain one.",-1,"train_neg"
"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it, since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous!",-1,"train_neg"
"first let me give you the bad things:  1. the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod, and it weighs a little bit more.",-1,"train_neg"
"2. the scroll button isn't the best, as it sometimes can be hard to select.",-1,"train_neg"
"difficulties with tags.",-1,"train_neg"
"otherwise, you'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the (decent) nomad explorer, which is not fun at all.",-1,"train_neg"

"but who wants the wires involved.",-1,"train_neg"
"a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer.",-1,"train_neg"
"details:  don't drop this unit:  i've had the player for about a month now.",-1,"train_neg"
"as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days.",-1,"train_neg"
"i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke.",-1,"train_neg"

"if you're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end (typically 128 is considered close to cd quality).",-1,"train_neg"
"one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes.",-1,"train_neg"
"i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3's in the mp3 format.",-1,"train_neg"
"it using something called ac3 (at least the trial song i purchased was in this format) which is not a compatible format for the nomad.",-1,"train_neg"
"i haven't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes.",-1,"train_neg"
"but for now it appears that this player doesn't play well with itunes.",-1,"train_neg"
"scroll bar:  the scroll bar is a bit of a pain.",-1,"train_neg"
"sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items.",-1,"train_neg"
"it's not the end of the world, but a better design sure would be nice.",-1,"train_neg"
"sound:  the sound from the player is ok.  i was a little disappointed in the low end.",-1,"train_neg"
"i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended.",-1,"train_neg"
"the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected.",-1,"train_neg"

"it was not my first choice.",-1,"train_neg"
"sure enough there is no such ability.",-1,"train_neg"
"not sure, if customer rep. did not know the product exactly, it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear.",-1,"train_neg"
"in any case, navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders.",-1,"train_neg"
"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre, no other division.",-1,"train_neg"
"creative is talking about updating it via firmware, however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players, looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates, not too much of new features.",-1,"train_neg"
"the software, which comes with player is not good at all.",-1,"train_neg"
"i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work.",-1,"train_neg"
"after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad.",-1,"train_neg"
"often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables.",-1,"train_neg"
"artist, album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player, and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory.",-1,"train_neg"
"the bottom line, i'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver.",-1,"train_neg"
"the bundled software blows, yes...... but i heard of notmad explorer (http://redchairsoftware.com) from the creative tech support people.",-1,"train_neg"
"so yes, as with all software bundled with creative products, it was useless and ugly.",-1,"train_neg"
"originally i wanted the ipod.",-1,"train_neg"
"so what?",-1,"train_neg"
"i can do that myself.",-1,"train_neg"
"i haven't checked the resilience of my xtra yet, and don't plan to.",-1,"train_neg"
"it can get pretty lonely out there.",-1,"train_neg"
"i only have one question, when i add tracks to my nomad, via nomad explorer, they are automatically put in alphebetical order, rather than album order.",-1,"train_neg"
"is this possible to fix, if so how, if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this?",-1,"train_neg"
"wow...  this thing is trash.",-1,"train_neg"
"want the laundry list of reasons why?",-1,"train_neg"
"a) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop  b) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display  c) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said  d) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on  e) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage  f) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course  so...  im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead.",-1,"train_neg"
"don't waste your time, engery, resources on this thing, just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod.",-1,"train_neg"
"don't buy it.",-1,"train_neg"
"what a disappointment.",-1,"train_neg"
"the software failed repeatedly.",-1,"train_neg"
"i couldn't load more than one song before the software crashed.",-1,"train_neg"
"creative labs customer support website is useless.",-1,"train_neg"
"software downloads on the site crashed my pc.",-1,"train_neg"
"creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this.",-1,"train_neg"
"don't buy this thing.",-1,"train_neg"
"it has a few inconveniences: one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd.",-1,"train_neg"
"another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long, it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on.",-1,"train_neg"
"ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement.",-1,"train_neg"
"the case is strong and stylish, but unfortunately lacks a window (now a big deal).",-1,"train_neg"
"the headphone earbuds are average, so just use your regular pair instead.",-1,"train_neg"
"on my main computer the software did not work right.",-1,"train_neg"
"i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all.",-1,"train_neg"
"i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself.",-1,"train_neg"
"it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work, because it works on all the other computers i have.",-1,"train_neg"
"first there's the unit itself.",-1,"train_neg"
"the environmental audio, however, is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it (i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates.)",-1,"train_neg"
"for prospective buyers, i would warn of the following: 1) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible, as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable (this applies to earbuds in general,) and 2) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them, that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves.",-1,"train_neg"
"read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it!!",-1,"train_neg"
"and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need.",-1,"train_neg"
"usb 2.0 - very fast  yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap, replace them.",-1,"train_neg"
"however, it doesn't register instantly as a hard drive like other players.",-1,"train_neg"
"you have to install the software to the computer you're transferring to, instead of just connecting it with a usb connection.",-1,"train_neg"
"this would have been much easier.",-1,"train_neg"
"cons:  navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs.",-1,"train_neg"
"it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system.",-1,"train_neg"
"you can't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it.",-1,"train_neg"
"fm receiver - it has none.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations.",-1,"train_neg"
"cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners.",-1,"train_neg"
"the player feels very delicate, as if i'm holding an actual hard drive.",-1,"train_neg"
"i'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet.",-1,"train_neg"
"as a portable player, it should feel a bit more durable.",-1,"train_neg"
"i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to.",-1,"train_neg"
"this is not a player you can take jogging.",-1,"train_neg"
"the songs don't play one after another like on a cd.",-1,"train_neg"
"you have to add them to the playing list.",-1,"train_neg"
"i can't simply bring up my entire list of songs, click play, and then hit next.",-1,"train_neg"
"you have to add all the songs to a play list.",-1,"train_neg"
"there is probably an easier way to do this, i just haven't found it yet.",-1,"train_neg"
"software - the software is crap.",-1,"train_neg"
"otherwise, it is difficult to figure out and awkward.",-1,"train_neg"
"like most people, i don't want to read the instructions, i just want to use it.",-1,"train_neg"
"even after reading some of the instructions, it's still hard to figure out.",-1,"train_neg"
"no line out jack - as i said, there is none.",-1,"train_neg"
"so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter, but you don't get the quality from a true line out jack.",-1,"train_neg"
"it sounds decent, but i would estimate you get maybe 80% of the quality that you would from a true line out jack.",-1,"train_neg"
"controls are a bit awkward.",-1,"train_neg"
"the controls definately took some getting used to.",-1,"train_neg"
"it wasn't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman.",-1,"train_neg"
"when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was.",-1,"train_neg"
"a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included.",-1,"train_neg"
"i want to have instant access to the volume, not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it.",-1,"train_neg"
"crappy headphones.",-1,"train_neg"
"the included earbuds were uncomfortable.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones.",-1,"train_neg"
"difficult navigation - i won't necessarily say "" difficult, "" but i don't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate.",-1,"train_neg"
"it is a bit cumbersome, and i can't get to the songs i want as quickly.",-1,"train_neg"
"i think this is it's biggest flaw.",-1,"train_neg"
"i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes.",-1,"train_neg"
"up, down, left, and right would have given me better control.",-1,"train_neg"
"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long (which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through), it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and won't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it.",-1,"train_neg"
"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen, and if the button didn't cover up the ac jack.",-1,"train_neg"
"as it stands now, the case is pretty useless unless you're packing the player up for travel, or if you load up all your songs beforehand.",-1,"train_neg"
"you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though.",-1,"train_neg"
"good for the money, but software is awful.",-1,"train_neg"
"a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins, accesses files or does antyhing.",-1,"train_neg"
"but the major problem i had was with the software.",-1,"train_neg"
"you are not able to simply import files, but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them.",-1,"train_neg"
"the instructions that come with it don't explain how to make things simple.",-1,"train_neg"
"the quick sync isn't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just isn't very useful.",-1,"train_neg"
"i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused.",-1,"train_neg"
"well that was not a simple task.",-1,"train_neg"
"i ended up suing windows player to make mp3's (actually wma files) and then using the probram to transfer.",-1,"train_neg"
"i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer, becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate.",-1,"train_neg"
"an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper.",-1,"train_neg"
"i purchased this player last week.",-1,"train_neg"
"the headphones aren't the best, but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity.",-1,"train_neg"
"difficult to manage large library.",-1,"train_neg"
"i purchased and returned this product, but not because of any glaring flaws in the design.",-1,"train_neg"
"i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device.",-1,"train_neg"
"i quickly discovered that the nomad wasn't going to work for me.",-1,"train_neg"
"here's why:  1. i don't need the nomad at the office.",-1,"train_neg"
"3. it's a hazard in the car.",-1,"train_neg"
"the navigation is nice enough, but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks, hundreds of albums or artists, or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving.",-1,"train_neg"
"(throw a cell phone and you're asking for trouble.)",-1,"train_neg"
"creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 wasn't as easy as i would have liked.",-1,"train_neg"
"the bottom line:  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions, i'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk.",-1,"train_neg"
"one major complaint:  my only significant complaint is sound quality.",-1,"train_neg"
"the eax sound enhancement feature didn't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq.",-1,"train_neg"
"this did not give me enough control.",-1,"train_neg"
"i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter.",-1,"train_neg"
"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost.",-1,"train_neg"
"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it, it will be a breeze.",-1,"train_neg"
"software: for the people who complain about software, please, stop complaining.",-1,"train_neg"
"my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags &amp; that takes a while to do if your mp3 files don't have them.",-1,"train_neg"
"people complain about the scroll wheel, but its not a big deal at all (though it is just a little annoying at times).",-1,"train_neg"
"but the earbuds suck!",-1,"train_neg"
"every time you move your face or something they pop out.",-1,"train_neg"
"for a 250 dollar player, they could have thrown in nice headphones.",-1,"train_neg"
"a remote would have been cool too... but lets not push it.",-1,"train_neg"
"i forgot, the case doesn't fit.",-1,"train_neg"
"my case doesnt close... maybe mine was just faulty, but the case isnt that great.",-1,"train_neg"
"so far the player froze on me once (i started pushing buttons before it loaded) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that.",-1,"train_neg"

"not just the transfer software (which was a hellishly horrible experience) but also the player's software.",-1,"train_neg"
"first of all, many actions that the player utilizes don't make sense..  bookmarks for example, are an excellent feature... but not on this player...  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area, the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made..  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks...  the dynamic playlists ("" now playing "", i belive creative calls it) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate...  well, anyway i could go on and on on why this player didn't meet my expectations...  i'll just say this...  for the average music listener not expecting much... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player...  but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback... i can't recommend this product.",-1,"train_neg"

"it seems like movement, even small movement, causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing.",-1,"test_neg"
"repair seems to be an issue; some say the repair don't exist  - you just have to buy a new player.",-1,"test_neg"
"perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories.",-1,"test_neg"
"like the zen, the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device.",-1,"test_neg"
"the karma does have a stop button.",-1,"test_neg"
"there aren't many reviews for the iriver ihp.",-1,"test_neg"
"the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow, leading to longer delays in some functions (playback and even a slow display of the menu?).",-1,"test_neg"
"no comments on reliability, warranty, repairs, accessories.",-1,"test_neg"
"no-one mentions whether there is a stop button, but the photos don't show one.",-1,"test_neg"

"accept that there will be better devices (or new generations of these ones) in a year or two that will cost less.",-1,"test_neg"
"if that is for you then pay the money, learn from the experience and you'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2.  if you aren't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment, or the cons outweigh the pros, then wait a year or so.",-1,"test_neg"
"but with a low price, comes lower quality.",-1,"test_neg"
"the catch is it's built like a piece of crap.",-1,"test_neg"
"it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks.",-1,"test_neg"
"i didn't abuse it, i charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out.",-1,"test_neg"
"i tried re-setting it, i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked.",-1,"test_neg"
"so i contacted customer service at creative, but they said, "" if the product seems broken, we cannot help, "" or something to that effect.",-1,"test_neg"
"software problem.",-1,"test_neg"
"here's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one.",-1,"test_neg"
"my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up.",-1,"test_neg"
"his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now.",-1,"test_neg"
"4.  easy to use: a lot of reviews has mentioned about this  con:  the software, mediasource, cannot work on my pc.",-1,"test_neg"
"a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here.",-1,"test_neg"
"in fact, each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place.",-1,"test_neg"
"i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem.",-1,"test_neg"
"well to say, i had a very bad history with players.",-1,"test_neg"
"one broke, one got stolen, and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350.  if you are planning to buy that player, do not!",-1,"test_neg"
"that player is a complete piece of sh ***.",-1,"test_neg"
"i returned it once, then i sent it back, and it is crap.",-1,"test_neg"
"(28 not 30 because software itself takes space).",-1,"test_neg"
"cons:  1.  the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with, in this player, is the battery life.",-1,"test_neg"
"the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours, and what i recieved was 6-8.",-1,"test_neg"
"5 hours max.",-1,"test_neg"
"i did it like this  eax on: 6 hours eax off: 8.5 hours  2.  the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said.",-1,"test_neg"
"3.  you need the software to actually transfer files  4.  the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on, 60 percent of the time, it sais, shutting down, which means i have to turn off, and turn it on again, which is not to my likings.",-1,"test_neg"
"also, the player sometimes freezes, not a very big problem, but can also be annoying.",-1,"test_neg"
"(but as any hard drive, all of them freeze at certain points)  well thats about it, and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up, stil havent happened to me, and i hope it doesnt.",-1,"test_neg"
"i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad.",-1,"test_neg"
"the ipod's white plastic look / surface doesn't suit me.",-1,"test_neg"
"the mini ipod's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage.",-1,"test_neg"
"yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway.",-1,"test_neg"
"cons.",-1,"test_neg"
"creative software stinks.",-1,"test_neg"
"it's horrible.",-1,"test_neg"
"the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i didn't notice after first day.",-1,"test_neg"
"cons:  short warranty (3 months, so i got the extended warranty at best buy), occasional freeze up (easily fixed by popping out battery), somewhat flimsy navigation wheel.",-1,"test_neg"
"the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance.",-1,"test_neg"
"does not function correctly, unhelpful customer service.",-1,"test_neg"
"don't buy this player.",-1,"test_neg"
"i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed (don't get me started on that piece of junk!)",-1,"test_neg"
"unfortunately, after loading 280 + songs, all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy.""",-1,"test_neg"
"it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do.",-1,"test_neg"
"don't buy this player.",-1,"test_neg"
"why can't it be rated zero stars?",-1,"test_neg"
"do not buy this product --  i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended.",-1,"test_neg"
"nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke.",-1,"test_neg"
"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products, which is very dumb.",-1,"test_neg"
"o man, not cool.",-1,"test_neg"
"one horrible flaw, or mayybe more than one.",-1,"test_neg"
"however, my hard drive did fail, and i have not dropped it once.",-1,"test_neg"
"therefore im saying im returning it right now, and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra (same replacement).",-1,"test_neg"
"if that one fails too, and i hope if it does, let it happen in the first 90 days, not later, cuz thats the warranty.",-1,"test_neg"
"if it does, ill give up.",-1,"test_neg"
"basically wat happened, is that the hard drive failed.",-1,"test_neg"
"thats it.",-1,"test_neg"
"i cant do anything about it, and i have to send back.",-1,"test_neg"
"the only good thing about this whole process, is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back, because of the price difference between when i bought it, and now.",-1,"test_neg"
"basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars, instead of 1.  you know why?",-1,"test_neg"
"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull, this player is awesome, it just breaks fast, which is horrible.",-1,"test_neg"
"now honestly, i love this player, but with all seriousness, i would not recommend it to other people, because of the breakdown flaw.",-1,"test_neg"
"and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod, that crap sucks big donkey..... never mind.",-1,"test_neg"
"i hope my next player doesnt breakdown..  honestly, the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players.",-1,"test_neg"
"what a junk.",-1,"test_neg"
"what a junk.",-1,"test_neg"
"every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes.",-1,"test_neg"
"the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode.",-1,"test_neg"
"so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can't use nomad until you get home.",-1,"test_neg"
"after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox.",-1,"test_neg"
"you will be very disappointed with this product.",-1,"test_neg"
"the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups: (1) those who have had the product for a few weeks and (2) those have had the product for a few months.",-1,"test_neg"
"the controls are somewhat harder to use, and there are some oddities about the software tagging system, but most people can live with this.",-1,"test_neg"
"and then it breaks.",-1,"test_neg"
"usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires.",-1,"test_neg"
"typically, the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others.",-1,"test_neg"
"the nomad is sent back to creative labs.",-1,"test_neg"
"they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period, creative will charge you to fix it.",-1,"test_neg"
"in my case, the bill was $ 81, about a third of what i paid for it.",-1,"test_neg"
"like many others, i had not abused the product, and had tried to take care of it.",-1,"test_neg"
"if my level of care wasn't good enough, i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two.",-1,"test_neg"
"i'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed, and will not hold up to normal use.",-1,"test_neg"
"the headphone jack seems to be a major problem.",-1,"test_neg"
"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover, which is taken off to have access to the battery, seemed to come undone very easily.",-1,"test_neg"
"the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire.",-1,"test_neg"
"even if it hasn't expired, creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty.",-1,"test_neg"
"and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase.",-1,"test_neg"
"so when it breaks, as it will, you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad.",-1,"test_neg"
"you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back.",-1,"test_neg"
"you will have a very expensive paperweight.",-1,"test_neg"
"there are not a lot of good options out there.",-1,"test_neg"
"most people say buy an ipod, but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery.",-1,"test_neg"
"my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops.",-1,"test_neg"
"maybe creative will come out with a better design, although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again.",-1,"test_neg"
"and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod.",-1,"test_neg"
"whatever you do, don't buy this product.",-1,"test_neg"
"you will be sorry if you do.",-1,"test_neg"
"piece of junk.",-1,"test_neg"
"the other day when i was listening to a song, it locked up and will not do anything now.",-1,"test_neg"
"it says i have a harddisk problem.",-1,"test_neg"
"and since i'm out here i can't mail it back under my 90 days and they won't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty.",-1,"test_neg"
